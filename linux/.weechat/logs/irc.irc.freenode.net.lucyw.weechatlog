2014-05-17 17:17:56	lucyw	http://lyricstranslate.com/en/shock-shock.html  lyrics and translation, as the lyrics can be hard to understand and I think are very high quality

2014-05-17 17:22:20	lucyw	For when you're done with the last one
2014-05-17 17:42:06	lucyw	http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2014/eecs162-001/assign/assign4.pdf
2014-05-17 18:40:13	lucyw	Hey, when are people leaving?
2014-05-17 18:40:21	lucyw	As in do you know/can you ask?
2014-05-18 09:48:45	lucyw	I have to admit, it's difficult to see what everyone's problems with HTML and CSS are.  They feel very simple -- almost childish in many ways -- yet garner many complaints and posts like that.  Are people just trying to be funny/like to complain about things?  Are there actual flaws with the way CSS operates that I just don't know about or see?
2014-05-18 09:48:57	lucyw	Actually, that's a question for lug.
2014-05-18 13:59:51	muricula	They suck! Have you ever tried to create an interactive webpage which responds to user input dynamically? If you just want to mark up text pictures and video with some nice colors that's simple.
2014-05-18 14:05:57	muricula	However those tools really weren't designed for the sorts of things people want to do these days, and each new version brings a variety of awkward hacks of new features to half fix these. Really it's a problem with poorly designed tools which did not anticpate the actual needs of the future.
2014-05-18 14:09:31	muricula	People complain about the quircks of javascript all the time, and for good reason. Also, even if you think you have something which works it probably uses tech which doesn't work, or worse yet works differently, in different browsers
2014-05-18 14:09:52	muricula	Performance isn't great either.
2014-05-18 14:12:12	muricula	Doing stuff like this is a pain in the ass:

2014-05-18 16:17:00	muricula	http://aeon.co/magazine/living-together/james-somers-web-developer-money/
2014-05-18 16:17:13	muricula	What do you think
2014-05-18 16:17:14	muricula	?
2014-05-18 19:43:46	lucyw	I mean...most programming is kind of a pain in the ass, if you look at it as a series of hacks and strange things having to do with obscure commands in order to get to a fairly simple result which is what you want.
2014-05-18 19:44:27	lucyw	But at the same time, trying to achieve efficiency and simplicity and beauty with those hacks, and piece them together in just the right way, is part of the fun and makes the result all the more rewarding.
2014-05-18 19:46:17	lucyw	I guess my point in the above is that I don't understand how other programming languages are different.  Perhaps this demonstrates a complete lack of understanding as to how languages operate, or what distinguishes a language which encourages non-hackish behavior from a language like CSS or Javascript.
2014-05-18 19:47:26	lucyw	But from my point of view, html, CSS, and javascript (particularly with jquery, and the DOM), are very user-friendly and accessible ways to make something.  Much more so than C++ or Haskell, certainly.
2014-05-18 19:48:26	lucyw	I mean, honestly, most of what I do feels straight-up silly.  I'm getting paid to tell one div to be red, one to be green, one to be positioned just so, etc.
2014-05-18 19:48:41	lucyw	I'll read the article now.
2014-05-18 20:03:23	muricula	http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~Gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html
2014-05-18 20:06:47	lucyw	 I know exactly what should be taught to the beginning student. The names and topics of the absolutely necessary lecture courses are easy to list, and this is what I have done below. It is my intention to search on the web where the really useful papers and books are, preferably downloadable as well. This way, the costs of becoming a theoretical physicist should not exceed much the price of a computer
2014-05-18 20:06:49	lucyw	with internet connection, a printer, and lots of paper and pens.
2014-05-18 20:07:56	lucyw	This is how all classes should be taught and treated, I believe.  It infuriates me to no end that we have to PAY for textbooks (knowledge in a mostly obsolete and unnecessarily expensive form), and that the internet is so often discredited in academic settings.
2014-05-18 20:08:12	lucyw	being that I believe we've had this conversation before, I'll leave my rant at that.
2014-05-18 20:38:16	lucyw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvEvATBiQ5U  if you're hard up for music
2014-05-18 21:43:53	muricula	would you be interested in reading through this?
2014-05-19 09:30:30	lucyw	Reading through what?  Also thank you so much for taking care of scoby and putting it in front of my door :)  much appreciated
2014-05-19 10:26:40	muricula	reading through the online course at the link I sent you.
2014-05-19 10:28:15	lucyw	Very much so, and I'm (likely) going to start here http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~Gadda001/goodtheorist/compphys.html
2014-05-19 10:28:37	lucyw	I mean, we'll see what manifests, and how much time I have, but certainly.
2014-05-19 15:09:14	lucyw	http://grads.iges.org/grads/downloads.html hey, how should I do this....the Centos one?  Source?  I'm uncertain...

2014-05-19 16:42:42	muricula	So, you want the centos one. That means it's a .rpm (which is just like a .deb except in a different format for rhel/centos)
2014-05-19 16:43:01	muricula	Actually wait, you're running ubuntu, right?
2014-05-19 16:43:30	muricula	If so, search the repositories to see if it's packaged. Otherwise just compile it from source
2014-05-19 16:44:46	muricula	Okay, just install this package from the ubuntu repos http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/grads
2014-05-19 21:23:01	lucyw	hey, Jeff and I are not sure what's happening.  There something about outputting into a binary file

2014-06-03 18:27:34	lucyw	Remember when I did the same thing over winter break?  It never really went away.  I just try not to make you uncomfortable, and am fine with just being friends if that's all you'd like to be.
2014-06-03 18:28:00	lucyw	But I'm glad you didn't notice--it would have been awkward if you had.

2014-06-05 13:43:27	muricula	I have no idea what you're talking about?

2014-06-05 13:46:51	lucyw	Well, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5wfvZlda7aabRNwu5Jlw8MBICGt7qO0OmB5ZFxsiCY/edit <--you and Jack were talking about having some kind of widget to display (I assume in a graph form) power consumption per project, and given that you commented on it and I know you're working with snmp I assumed it was towards this
2014-06-05 13:47:49	lucyw	I think I even asked you about the end goal and you said it was for fenestra (I might be making that up though)
2014-06-05 15:07:00	muricula	You are making the second part up
2014-06-05 15:07:42	muricula	Yeah, you don't know what I'm up to. Eventually there will be a json api which someone will be able to write a fenestra plugin for, but I am not working on that.
2014-06-05 15:08:57	lucyw	regardless, would you like jnoah's help?
2014-06-05 15:09:45	lucyw	well, you can ask for it if you'd like I suppose.
2014-06-05 15:11:54	muricula	no, it isn't possible to do that at this point in time. If he needs something to do, tell him to PM me, I think I can find a way for him to help the pdumaster project
2014-06-05 15:34:44	muricula	also, what was that last night? a copy pasta ail?
2014-06-05 15:34:54	muricula	*fail
2014-06-05 17:31:10	lucyw	No--you just commented on how close jnoah and I are, and quite frankly he makes me really uncomfortable sometimes.
2014-06-05 17:32:16	lucyw	I don't know if you especially care--I didn't expect you to, but you said something to the effect of "you guys are always talking to each other", and I wanted to clarify the status of my friendship with him.
2014-06-05 19:53:33	muricula	huh
2014-06-05 19:54:36	muricula	I still think that it would be difficult for you to say something to make me uncomfortable.
2014-06-05 19:54:58	lucyw	I think I already did, a little bit.
2014-06-05 19:57:54	muricula	no, I don't think so

2014-06-05 20:15:00	muricula	what?
2014-06-05 20:17:08	lucyw	That is the question.
2014-06-05 20:21:41	lucyw	Also, I think this challenge will end one of two ways: 1. I say something that actually makes you uncomfortable, and therefore makes us both uncomfortable, or 2. I don't succeed and...well, don't succeed
2014-06-05 20:22:18	lucyw	So...I choose that latter.  Unless there's some incentive to continue, but currently there isn't.  Also, that was an excellent post.

2014-06-08 00:17:10	muricula	So it seems to me that I am likely to drift apart from this group of friends next year. Part of me wants for that not to happen, and part of me wants to wander off anyway
2014-06-08 00:18:04	muricula	It's interesting to think about how this may play out, but without the lounge as a common home I think some of us will be scattered to the winds
2014-06-08 00:24:00	lucyw	Well, do you think they're very good friends?
2014-06-08 00:25:08	lucyw	I imagine you'll stay close to people who are worth making the effort to see, and just say hi in passing to those who aren't.  But...c'est la vie.  One is silver and the other is gold.
2014-06-08 00:25:13	lucyw	Or however that song went.
2014-06-08 21:29:50	muricula	Mildly personal question, in your eyes how close a friend am I to you?
2014-06-08 21:40:51	lucyw	Oh no!  Not personal questions!  Well...my answer depends a bit on the context for the question, but you're certainly someone I feel very comfortable around, care very much about, and who has had a significant impact on my life, all of which I consider to be primary qualities in a close friend
2014-06-08 21:42:55	lucyw	In terms of how that will change in the future, I imagine that will rely on how our respective activities align--I could certainly see you going to Mozilla or landing some other amazing job after school, moving somewhere else, and only getting an email every few months asking how things are.
2014-06-08 21:44:32	lucyw	But....if it's about the stupid beach thing to day (or the broader topic of this social group's relations), it makes me a little sad that you (and others) were excluded so deliberately, and I think points to how...not superficial, but fair-weather most of the friendships are.
2014-06-08 21:45:45	lucyw	In that way, I think you're right about most drifting apart.
2014-06-08 21:46:09	lucyw	And now I pose the same question to you.
2014-06-08 21:48:46	muricula	Sorry this had nothing to do with the beach.
2014-06-08 21:49:39	muricula	But you are correct in your assessment of this group
2014-06-08 21:49:59	muricula	You and Evan are (somewhat obviously) my closest friends right now
2014-06-08 21:52:17	muricula	There are few people in this group who I will make an effort to keep in touch with. A good example would be Raven, we are on the way to being fair friends, but I don't see her keeping in touch next year.
2014-06-08 21:54:00	muricula	You're right about respective activities, we will certainly see each other regularly through school at the very least because of work. Beyond that it is difficult to speculate.
2014-06-08 21:56:28	lucyw	Well, such is most things--it's difficult to know what our lives will be like a year from now, much less further into the future.  But I certainly hope to remain close friends with you and Evan (as if there's anyone who wishes to lose friends who are close to them).
2014-06-08 22:19:48	lucyw	And...well, of course, the slight possibility of being a little more than friends
2014-06-08 22:28:14	muricula	lucyw. I don't think I could stand being in a relationship with you. With anyone really, but especially you.
2014-06-08 22:30:57	lucyw	Haha, ok :)
2014-06-08 22:57:19	lucyw	sorry for asking--it just seemed as though you'd perhaps reconsidered.
2014-06-08 23:40:12	muricula	sorry to say something in such a way as to lead you to believe I was leading you on.
2014-06-08 23:40:40	muricula	I ask because in the past some of my best friends have not necessarily considered me one of their best friends
2014-06-09 14:16:36	muricula	do you feel proud of what you have accomplished this year?
2014-06-09 14:55:36	lucyw	Well, what qualifies as a best friend?  Or why would you consider tschuy and I in that category, rather?
2014-06-09 14:56:14	lucyw	Well...yes and no.  It's hard to feel proud where I'm at compared to my peers (ie. you, chance, emily, etc.)
2014-06-09 14:57:27	lucyw	At the same time I've certainly come a long way, both in how I view my education, how I take control of that education, and the sheer amount of knowledge in this field that I've gained.
2014-06-09 14:59:13	lucyw	I'm also proud of many of my activities: volunteering for the elementary school, starting the women in tech group, working for the osl.  I'd certainly highlight those in a positive reflection.
2014-06-09 15:02:28	lucyw	But....I've got a looooooong way to go.
2014-06-09 15:02:33	lucyw	And now I pose the question to you.
2014-06-09 15:05:09	muricula	It is pretty obvious to me what friends I feel closest to.
2014-06-09 15:08:08	muricula	No, I don't feel proud of what I've done. I think I've failed myself a lot this year, and I have not come as far as I wanted.  Pride in my work is incredibly valuable to me, but I am not proud of what I have accomplished in school, at the OSL, or outside of school.
2014-06-09 15:42:04	lucyw	Why do you think that happened?  It seems like you have a clear sense of where you'd like to go, and resources that could help you get there.
2014-06-09 15:49:39	muricula	I'm not sure I know where I'd like to go actually. There is a well paved and easy path out of here to a job as a programmer. The question is, should I take it or do something more interesting?
2014-06-09 15:49:57	muricula	I'm not sure I worked hard enough at some of the things which reall mattered.
2014-06-09 15:50:13	lucyw	Such as your kernel?
2014-06-09 15:50:36	muricula	That's one thing. Another is work on ORVSD etc.
2014-06-09 15:51:13	 *	muricula is feeling emotional this week, which is quite unusual and in some ways unseettling.
2014-06-09 15:57:03	lucyw	Why do you think that is?  Emotional in what way? (if you don't mind my asking)
2014-06-09 16:00:39	lucyw	Also, in regards to doing more interesting things, I think we both know the answer.  I think you were expecting more of your professors, and given Jennifer and whoever else they have teaching were uninspired and disappointed.  But I think (hope) that there's someone here who can 1. Be a mentor to you and 2. give you some awesome/interesting research to do
2014-06-09 16:00:45	lucyw	It's just a matter of finding that person.
2014-06-09 16:02:12	lucyw	Keep in mind, too, that they may be at a different university--one of the nice things about the state university system is that most of your credits will probably transfer around, so...don't be afraid to ask the CAT people if there's anyone there who they think would be better suited to that task (if you haven't already)
2014-06-09 18:09:22	muricula	I haven't asked the cat people yet, but I will be keeping PSU in mind.
2014-06-09 18:10:06	muricula	Sad and frustrated is how I feel, but that doesn't seem like quite the whole story.
2014-06-09 18:28:30	lucyw	Well, I'm sorry.  I hope going to mozilla turns things around a bit--it will definitely be a refreshing break from school/people-at-school, and should hopefully be a good challenge.  Anything I can do to help?
2014-06-09 18:41:22	muricula	no. Thanks for talking though
2014-06-10 09:20:49	lucyw	Hey, do you have a twitter account I could use for testing per chance?
2014-06-10 10:24:46	lucyw	Nevermind--I just set one up.  Other question, though: what do you think of Ken and Justin Dugger?
2014-06-10 12:35:38	muricula	muricula has a twitter
2014-06-10 12:38:46	muricula	Ken and Justin are very different people. Lance runs the OSL because he is a charitable person and a saint. Ken is probably here because it's a good job (even if there are better ones in the industry) and he has family here I think. Ken is very hands off, and I like that.
2014-06-10 12:39:35	muricula	Justin is very smart, but a total ass. However, if he agrees with something you say or gives assent to your project then it must be a good idea.
2014-06-10 12:39:47	muricula	what do you think of them
2014-06-10 12:39:48	muricula	?
2014-06-10 12:47:57	lucyw	Well, I was talking to Ken about fenestra, and I realized that while I too really appreciate his hands-off-ness, as it gives me license to do pretty much whatever as long as I keep github straight, I don't think he actually....does very much
2014-06-10 12:48:52	lucyw	In terms of accomplishing things.  In a way, I have really mixed feelings about it--I don't *want* him to do more, because it'd probably involve badgering me, but at the same time don't know that I have a whole lot of respect for him.
2014-06-10 12:50:03	lucyw	Justin is more or less the same, though you trade knowledge for irritation.
2014-06-10 12:51:49	muricula	Justin does a lot more than Ken, you just don't see it since he does it with the sys admins.
2014-06-10 12:52:22	muricula	You're right though. I suspect that you, like me, respect those who do significant things.
2014-06-10 12:52:41	muricula	(which brings me back to my accomplishments over the course of the year)
2014-06-10 12:57:04	muricula	Also, a more hands on boss can also be a good thing. Last summer I wrote a peice of software which offered terminal averse windows users a way to get info, run tests, and change device settings for a display module. Every day my boss would come over with a new idea or new functionality for the application.
2014-06-10 13:00:19	lucyw	Definitely--and I do wish there were more projects to work on, or at least more ideas for projects (Speaking of which, I've been trying to think of some good+useful ones to suggest once fenestra and the site templates are done--if you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them)
2014-06-10 13:00:46	lucyw	In that way, I wish there was more direction/guidance.
2014-06-10 13:01:23	muricula	Well I have a chef coobook you could fix or, if that sounds boring, there is the PDU master project.
2014-06-10 13:01:58	muricula	PDU master is interesting because it runs the gammit from a low level protocol, to a json webserver.
2014-06-10 13:02:23	muricula	(gammit or gammut? I've seen both)
2014-06-10 13:04:02	muricula	(gamut is correct, http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=gamut&searchmode=none
2014-06-10 13:04:04	muricula	)
2014-06-10 13:14:02	lucyw	Ooo, sure.
2014-06-10 13:14:17	lucyw	I can take on PDU master
2014-06-10 13:14:57	muricula	Finish fenestra and ask Ken. I can get you started, and Emily can explain some stuff too.
2014-06-10 13:15:33	muricula	http://git.osuosl.org/?p=gitolite/pdumaster.git;a=summary
2014-06-10 13:19:00	lucyw	M'k, sounds good.

2014-06-25 09:58:39	lucyw	Do you think we should make a concious and concerted effort to preserve languages, written or spoken? Does it depend on the language, or circumstances, or are all languages created equal?
2014-06-25 15:05:30	muricula	What brings this up?
2014-06-25 15:07:12	muricula	Languages live, change, and die. We should endeavor to preserve remnents of languages for future study. It is impossible to preserve all languages, but we should provide enough material to the future that languages can be studied and if desired reborn.
2014-06-25 15:08:24	muricula	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew
2014-06-25 15:14:15	muricula	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revived_languages
2014-06-25 15:15:37	muricula	By the way, the majority of those languages listed are in their death throes, or are zombies like Latin.
2014-06-25 16:05:01	lucyw	https://medium.com/@eteraz/the-death-of-the-urdu-script-9ce935435d90
2014-06-25 16:05:53	lucyw	And yes--I'd imagine resurrecting a language would be only slightly easier than resurrecting a person, particularly considering it'd be a very artificial process.
2014-06-25 16:06:22	lucyw	That's an interesting wiki page though! I didn't know of most of them.
2014-06-25 16:08:39	lucyw	I find it interesting, though, how people labor to preserve what is (animal species is another prime example which comes to mind, though is an almost entirely separate issue given the manner in which most animals are dying and the larger puzzle which their extinction is a piece of).

2014-06-30 20:39:47	muricula	It's really cute. There's a bunch of similar pictures around the office
2014-07-01 08:50:43	lucyw	Awwww!  Que lindo :3
2014-07-01 08:51:00	lucyw	Did you read Calvin and Hobbes as a kid?
2014-07-01 10:40:17	muricula	That's how I learned to read
2014-07-01 10:45:51	lucyw	Well, that explains a lot
2014-07-01 10:54:05	muricula	How did you learn to read?
2014-07-01 13:01:17	lucyw	Well, Atlas Shrugged was my first book, then I started getting into Tolstoy and just went from there.
2014-07-01 13:02:20	lucyw	Did you ever read the "My father's dragon" books? Those were how both my brother and I learned.
2014-07-01 13:02:22	muricula	Hah hah. Really, what was one of the first books you read?
2014-07-01 13:02:54	muricula	No I didn't
2014-07-01 13:04:02	lucyw	Just books like that. Pippi Longstocking, judy bloom (blume?), etc.
2014-07-01 13:04:57	muricula	okay
2014-07-01 13:07:07	lucyw	Sorry--not as exciting as Calvin and Hobbes.
