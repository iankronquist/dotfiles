2014-07-02 15:51:31	muricula	We may want to ping this guy
2014-07-02 15:53:18	muricula	So next fall I'm taking computation theory honors (the textbook is GEB, so I'm excited), MTH 306, ECE 271, and probably CS 261. I was going to take the chem sequence, but I'm not sure that I'm going to enjoy chemistry.
2014-07-02 15:53:58	muricula	(I don't need the chem for my major)
2014-07-02 15:54:16	muricula	you?
2014-07-02 15:54:16	irdan	what's 261 again?
2014-07-02 15:54:22	muricula	data structures
2014-07-02 15:54:26	irdan	ah
2014-07-02 15:54:35	irdan	ece271 was a joke when i took it
2014-07-02 15:54:46	irdan	and half of 306 is really easy
2014-07-02 15:55:08	irdan	they want us to code from sept-april
2014-07-02 15:55:12	irdan	ish
2014-07-02 15:55:20	muricula	There's also work and stuff, but I'm excited about this opportunity.
2014-07-02 15:55:22	irdan	so i'm not quite sure what that means, but i will reach out to that guy
2014-07-02 15:55:33	irdan	yea, it's a really interesting project
2014-07-02 15:55:53	irdan	awesome experience and could be extremeley useful to a lot of people
2014-07-02 15:57:30	irdan	i'm taking computer security, math 351, and cs411 plus a gen ed of some kind i can't recall right now
2014-07-02 15:57:34	irdan	in the fall
2014-07-02 16:17:04	irdan	looks like he is located in florida, so we probably won't hear from him until tomorrow
2014-07-02 16:19:14	muricula	yep
