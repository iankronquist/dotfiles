2014-05-15 11:39:54	mathuin	Ugh.  Postfix.  Hate j00.
2014-05-15 11:40:21	mathuin	"fatal: unknown service: smtp/tcp" even though /etc/services and /var/spool/postfix/etc/services both exist and both have smtp in them
2014-05-15 11:56:06	mathuin	If anyone out there has experience fussing with Postfix, any help would be appreciated.
2014-05-15 11:58:35	Odysimus	I'm assuming people are otherwise engaged but cmartin0 mathuin and akeym there is a BCARES meeting tonight at 7 at the county shops off avery drive.
2014-05-15 11:59:41	mathuin	Do they meet monthly?
2014-05-15 12:03:52	Odysimus	mathuin: yes on the third Thursday of each month, except December as that is often right around Christmas]
2014-05-15 12:04:58	mathuin	*nod*
2014-05-15 12:06:27	Odysimus	also I'm going to wrap a paper towel roll in foil and put one of the foxes in it as cmartin0 took one of the antennas out the hall and around the corner and couldn't get tell direction even with the fox at -6dBm
2014-05-15 12:07:01	mathuin	Ugh!  How much of that is Snell hell?
2014-05-15 12:08:43	Odysimus	not sure, but a fox hunting trick is to put your receiver in a foil lined tube, so i figure the reverse might help reduce the signal
2014-05-15 12:09:13	mathuin	I wasn't sure if that was as a collimator or an attenuator.
2014-05-15 12:12:01	Odysimus	its mainly to deal with the fact that most HT's aren't well shielded so any anttenuation beyond 30-60dB on the input isn't effective as the signal penetrates that case
2014-05-15 12:12:30	Odysimus	so you hang your radio in a tube, then spin around and use body blocking
2014-05-15 12:13:59	mathuin	Oh the whole radio is in the tube?  Wacky.
2014-05-15 12:14:33	Odysimus	yea, often with no antenna or just a paperclip
2014-05-15 12:15:08	mathuin	I've done the paperclip thing for reception, it worked pretty well.

2014-05-15 13:30:30	chekkaa	I understood some of those words
2014-05-15 13:32:34	mathuin	Fox hunting in radio parlance is searching for a hidden transmitter.  It is very very helpful to know the direction to the transmitter.  If you reduce the ability of the radio to receive far enough that it barely receives the signal, you could then use your body to block the signal.
2014-05-15 13:32:43	mathuin	Just turn around until the signal goes away, and the transmitter is behind you somewhere.
2014-05-15 13:33:29	mathuin	One way to reduce the radio's ability to receive is to replace the antenna with something which doesn't work quite as well.  Paperclips are not very good antennas, at least on these wavelengths.
2014-05-15 13:33:56	mathuin	This is sorta like the radio version of the swimming pool game "Marco Polo".
2014-05-15 13:43:00	bryon	that prompts the question: what is the analog of "fish out of water"?
2014-05-15 13:43:43	edunham	bryon: hiding in a faraday cage, perhaps?
2014-05-15 13:43:51	bryon	heehee

2014-05-15 14:07:42	mathuin	"radiosport" is what I've heard it called.  It's basically ham radio meets orienteering.

2014-05-16 11:14:37	Ac-town	also increase bandwidth to 130000

2014-05-16 12:39:26	phc_office	you guys should swing by.  ill be there from like 10 to 6.... it's next to the old habitat for humanity place, next to orange electronics and lock doc, across from elk's lodge and Jackson gas station
2014-05-16 12:39:56	phc_office	Audiofiles.  you'll see some balloons and shit out front
2014-05-16 12:40:52	phc_office	applied electrical engineering
2014-05-16 12:57:25	phc_office	engineering types have more money to invest in high-end audio once they have larger disposable income
2014-05-16 12:57:57	phc_office	but my bet is that a few of these people will get at least somewhat into sound reproduction at some point in time in their lives ----->
2014-05-16 12:58:22	phc_office	don't go to the sound pressure competition for audio quality however
2014-05-16 12:59:22	phc_office	that'll be a seconds-long "burp" at the competitor's single loudest frequency - usually, for an array of 15-inch speakers, for example - in the 40- or 50-hertz range
2014-05-16 13:02:21	phc_office	basically, not musical.
2014-05-16 13:03:42	phc_office	anyway, that's my pitch.

2014-05-16 20:03:56	mythmon	jnoah: two plugins. let me grab the names.
2014-05-16 20:04:26	mythmon	the one that colors things in files is "Atom Color Highlight".
2014-05-16 20:04:36	mythmon	the one that actually does the color picking is "Color Picker"
2014-05-16 20:05:29	jnoah	mythmon: awesome. i just grabbed one called color which changes the background of the text to that color and color picker
2014-05-16 20:05:41	jnoah	https://atom.io/packages/color
2014-05-16 20:05:57	jnoah	heh, does the same thing
2014-05-16 20:06:06	mythmon	the "show on line end" bit is new though.
2014-05-16 20:06:10	mythmon	that's kind of interesting.
2014-05-16 20:07:02	jnoah	color highlight does rgba/etc colorn whereas color does not it looks like
2014-05-16 20:07:15	jnoah	s/colorn/colors/
2014-05-16 20:07:15	@hamper	jnoah actually meant: color highlight does rgba/etc colors whereas color does not it looks like
2014-05-16 20:08:05	mythmon	ah
2014-05-16 20:09:15	jnoah	mythmon: oooh https://atom.io/packages/minimap-color-highlight does svg as well
2014-05-16 20:09:39	mythmon	jnoah: that just does stuff to the minimap
2014-05-16 20:09:46	mythmon	which i don't use.
2014-05-16 20:10:00	mythmon	it ties into atom-color-hightlight, the one i'm using :)
2014-05-16 20:10:08	jnoah	oh, ha
2014-05-16 20:10:50	mythmon	i'm sad that syntax themes and ui themes are lumped together.
2014-05-16 20:10:56	mythmon	it makes it hard to search for one or the other.
2014-05-16 20:11:42	mythmon	like right now i would like to find a ui theme that goes better with solarized-dark-syntax.
2014-05-16 20:14:03	chance	they arent lumped together
2014-05-16 20:14:21	chance	soda dark + solarized dark
2014-05-16 20:14:23	mythmon	in the search they are
2014-05-16 20:14:42	jnoah	i'm currently porting over https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim (sample http://i.imgur.com/8JNjVQB.png )
2014-05-16 20:14:44	mythmon	the editor has them in a separate list as ui themes and syntax themes, but i can only search for themes, regardless of type.
2014-05-16 20:14:54	mythmon	a syntax theme, right?
2014-05-16 20:14:57	jnoah	yeah
2014-05-16 20:15:05	mythmon	yeah, i found a syntax theme i like
2014-05-16 20:15:11	mythmon	it's a ui theme i lack.
2014-05-16 20:15:13	jnoah	and yeah, syntax and ui themes should be separate
2014-05-16 20:15:28	chance	you can search for syntax themes too
2014-05-16 20:15:30	chance	and ui themes
2014-05-16 20:15:35	chance	i dont know what your talking about
2014-05-16 20:15:35	jnoah	ui theme currently is redeye with obsidian as the syntax
2014-05-16 20:16:07	mythmon	chance: where can i search for only ui themes?
2014-05-16 20:16:08	chance	oh i see, your talking about in search
2014-05-16 20:16:14	jnoah	chance: they are both lumped into one category
2014-05-16 20:16:19	mythmon	"themes"
2014-05-16 20:16:38	mythmon	soda doesn't fix my problem though
2014-05-16 20:16:50	chance	add the word "ui" to the search for a theme, add "syntax" for a syntax
2014-05-16 20:16:53	chance	works well enough
2014-05-16 20:16:57	mythmon	the background for solarized dark is kind of bluish, which imo clashes against a grey backgrounded editor ui.
2014-05-16 20:17:01	mythmon	chance: but not great.
2014-05-16 20:17:11	mythmon	and there are a bunch of themes that don't say that, so the search will miss them.
2014-05-16 20:17:57	jnoah	oh wow, color picker is amazing
2014-05-16 20:19:28	jnoah	mythmon: now all color highlight needs to do is follow less variables...
2014-05-16 20:19:50	mythmon	jnoah: it is extensible. you might be able to do that.
2014-05-16 20:19:53	mythmon	but it also might be hard.
2014-05-16 20:20:09	mythmon	hmm. Monokai and Soda Dark seem to work well
2014-05-16 20:20:15	mythmon	it also fixes a problem I was having with Solarized dark.
2014-05-16 20:20:53	jnoah	though 'lighten(@dark-gray, 10%);' might be hardhard
2014-05-16 20:21:03	jnoah	yes, double hard
2014-05-16 20:21:19	mythmon	depends on how lighten works.
2014-05-16 20:22:54	jnoah	obtw, chance, mythmon i was emailing with one of the core devs. there's ##atom, it is unofficial, but the core devs will be stopping by from time to time. they want to have an "office hours" type of thing in there
2014-05-16 20:22:57	mythmon	jnoah: what do you think of Coffeescript?
2014-05-16 20:23:03	jnoah	I like
2014-05-16 20:23:08	jnoah	but i don't like braces
2014-05-16 20:23:13	jnoah	so i am biased
2014-05-16 20:23:18	mythmon	jnoah: yeah, I knew about ##atom. There is also http://discuss.atom.io
2014-05-16 20:23:20	mythmon	which is official
2014-05-16 20:24:27	jnoah	ok, now i need something like dropbox or the like to sync my atom prefs between boxes...

2014-05-16 20:26:00	mythmon	jnoah: have you seen syncthing?
2014-05-16 20:26:06	mythmon	it's like bittorrent sync, but open.
2014-05-16 20:26:07	jnoah	no
2014-05-16 20:26:26	jnoah	wasn't that on HN with the last few days?
2014-05-16 20:26:54	jnoah	i remember possibly seeing a link for it, but didn't check it out
2014-05-16 20:27:52	mythmon	maybe. i think i heard about it from $coworker
2014-05-16 20:31:14	jnoah	wow, that's, uh, rediculously simple
2014-05-16 20:31:29	jnoah	as in teachable to parents easy
2014-05-16 20:31:49	jnoah	ok, setup is anyway
2014-05-16 20:33:35	mythmon	jnoah: lighten(@dark-gray, 10%) should come for free if you implement @dark-grey
2014-05-16 20:33:39	mythmon	source: I read the code.
2014-05-16 20:34:27	jnoah	heh, awesome
2014-05-16 20:35:38	jnoah	hmm, onething kinda lame about synthing currently, is the service must restart when adding/removing repositories (folders). The good thing though, it's a one click button in the webui

2014-05-19 09:13:36	terrellt	But training is a part of the gig.
2014-05-19 09:14:13	edunham	probably mint or regular debian then
2014-05-19 09:14:30	edunham	try cinnamon as a wm
2014-05-19 09:15:00	terrellt	Will do.
2014-05-19 09:15:04	edunham	set terminator as default when they click "gimme a terminal" and they might discover tiling on their own

2014-05-19 10:33:52	muricula	yeah, on flip
2014-05-19 10:34:57	muricula	If I'm having this much trouble bootstrapping some basic python modules I wonder if I'll even be able to get apache to serve the site.
2014-05-19 10:35:40	mythmon	muricula: that really depends on how apache is configured.
2014-05-19 10:35:47	mythmon	it's kind of a pain to shoehorn in python.
2014-05-19 10:35:53	mythmon	muricula: does it have to run on an osu server?

2014-05-19 10:40:09	muricula	I'll ask about it
2014-05-19 10:40:15	mythmon	also, using a database from php on the shell server sounds easier.
2014-05-19 10:40:31	mythmon	because it's basically "LOL PHP CAN HAS SQL" and it's like "SURE BRO"
2014-05-19 10:40:58	muricula	with all that sql injection and md5 collision
2014-05-19 10:41:06	mythmon	md5?

2014-05-19 10:41:43	mythmon	or do you have to?

2014-05-19 10:42:15	mythmon	ah
2014-05-19 10:42:20	mythmon	i wouldn't worry about it too much
2014-05-19 10:42:25	frostsnow	muricula: You can use 'htmlentites' to avoid SQL injection if you don't know
2014-05-19 10:42:30	mythmon	do the shitty thing, don't use a password you like.
2014-05-19 10:42:39	muricula	yep

2014-05-19 10:43:40	muricula	thanks. I am doing some real webdev stuff at the OSL of course, but it's annoying to be told to use tools from another century when I know there is better stuff out there.
2014-05-19 10:43:56	mythmon	yeah

2014-05-19 10:50:35	terrellt	It's not like blowfish is hard in PHP even.
2014-05-19 10:52:28	terrellt	I get upset when professors teach you to run SQL parameters through some arbitrary escaping function too. Parameterized queries have been around for a while.
2014-05-19 10:53:19	pwnguin	i should really leave a parir of glasses at work, in case i forget the good pair at home
2014-05-19 10:56:35	pwnguin	i get the impression professors are much more at home with spreadsheets than sql
2014-05-19 10:56:56	pwnguin	because after all, professors as a class are just a subclass of manager
2014-05-19 10:58:32	terrellt	I realize there aren't a lot of web development courses, and certainly not many that go in depth, but it still bothers me. For the few there are, at least reach out for a guest lecture or two.
2014-05-19 11:00:39	rordway	terrellt: at least they're teaching them not to use plain text passwords
2014-05-19 11:01:40	terrellt	rordway: Yes, at least they're not using a rusty knife to stab them in the foot.
2014-05-19 11:02:19	pwnguin	terrellt: they do reach out for guest lectures
2014-05-19 11:02:25	terrellt	Good!
2014-05-19 11:02:27	terrellt	I hadn't heard.
2014-05-19 11:02:37	terrellt	Then I retract that piece.
2014-05-19 11:02:47	pwnguin	at least, the stories i hear involve guest lecturers demoing SQL injection on the teacher's demo site
2014-05-19 11:04:23	terrellt	That makes for a good lecture.

2014-05-19 11:07:55	mythmon	for any interested, the FirefoxOS developer device, the Flame, is going on sale for general audiences (global) at the end of the month. price is $170.

2014-05-19 11:10:15	frostsnow	Ahh, okay
2014-05-19 11:10:47	mythmon	it comes with neat features like being able to scale the ram for testing on lower end devices, and it has lots of hardware features.
2014-05-19 11:11:03	mythmon	and by that i mean it is supposed to be a superset of all firefox os phones.
2014-05-19 11:11:34	mythmon	and there is supposedly some sort of commitment to keeping it up to date, and also making it easy to flash, and easy to switch from nightly to release to old versions etc.
2014-05-19 11:11:53	frostsnow	Interesting. How FOSS is the hardware? I'd love to get a FOSS phone sometime, though I'm not currently an app dev.
2014-05-19 11:13:22	mythmon	foss hardware is not the battle we are fighting. I don't know specifics, but i imagine it still has a traditional baseband, etc.
2014-05-19 11:13:38	mythmon	but i also imagine that you should be able to get drivers to make your images just fine.
2014-05-19 11:13:50	mythmon	s/your image/your own images to flash/
2014-05-19 11:13:51	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: but i also imagine that you should be able to get drivers to make your own images to flashs just fine.
2014-05-19 11:14:12	mythmon	possibly as binary blobs, but they exist.
2014-05-19 11:14:12	frostsnow	Gotcha.

2014-05-19 13:03:05	mythmon	frostsnow: your encoding is bad and you should feel bad.
2014-05-19 13:03:46	frostsnow	mythmon: It is. I don't. One of these days I may look into setting up better character encoding with Gentoo. Maybe :P
2014-05-19 13:04:05	mythmon	frostsnow: utf-8 is the only encoding.
2014-05-19 13:05:26	frostsnow	mythmon: Yeah, I don't know why it's not working, since I have 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8' enabled in my '/etc/locale.gen' file
2014-05-19 13:06:02	mythmon	frostsnow: there are some other things too.
2014-05-19 13:06:20	mythmon	frostsnow: which client?
2014-05-19 13:06:46	frostsnow	mythmon: xterm, and sshing into another box (don't know how multiple boxes handle locales, either)
2014-05-19 13:06:54	mythmon	frostsnow: i meant what irc client.
2014-05-19 13:06:58	Ac-town	is everything utf8 when you type locale?
2014-05-19 13:07:00	frostsnow	mythmon: Ah, irssi
2014-05-19 13:07:17	frostsnow	Ac-town: Nope, 'posix'
2014-05-19 13:07:36	mythmon	frostsnow: yeah, that's a problem.
2014-05-19 13:07:50	mythmon	those need to say something about utf-8. all of them.
2014-05-19 13:07:51	mythmon	have fun.
2014-05-19 13:07:53	frostsnow	mythmon: irssi or the posix?
2014-05-19 13:07:55	frostsnow	haha
2014-05-19 13:07:57	mythmon	frostsnow: posix.
2014-05-19 13:08:00	frostsnow	Yeah, hence why I haven't bothered yet :P
2014-05-19 13:08:06	frostsnow	Time vs reward is quite small
2014-05-19 13:08:13	Ac-town	could kill irssi also
2014-05-19 13:08:27	frostsnow	I'm sure I'll stumble upon it eventually as I read more about Linux, then I'll fix it
2014-05-19 13:08:44	mythmon	for arch, it is something set in /etc/profile

2014-05-19 13:09:07	mythmon	well, actually, /etc/profile.d/locale.sh, but close enough.
2014-05-19 13:09:18	frostsnow	Ac-town: *bookmarks*
2014-05-19 13:19:01	frostsnow	Hmm, does '~' work as a valid path-specifier in Linux System Calls? Problem: mkdir("~/.2048", 0755) is failing with ENOENT ("No such file or directory").
2014-05-19 13:19:24	mythmon	frostsnow: no.
2014-05-19 13:19:45	mythmon	you need to give a full path. if you don't know that, you should look at the HOME environment variable.
2014-05-19 13:19:52	mythmon	~ is an invention of your shell.

2014-05-19 15:11:42	mythmon	if you are really clever you might be able to use the centos package, but don't try to be clever today.
2014-05-19 15:11:46	lucyw	safe to assume clang can compile it?
2014-05-19 15:12:00	mythmon	it should have an INSTALL or README file that explains that.
2014-05-19 15:12:04	mythmon	it is safe to assume nothing.
2014-05-19 15:12:16	mythmon	very likely it is going to be ./configure; make
2014-05-19 15:12:19	mythmon	but read the docs.

2014-05-19 18:56:05	chance	oh well
2014-05-19 19:09:24	chekkaa	mythmon: I was thinking more like when knowing the biome at a location is necessary, you calculate it then and there
2014-05-19 19:09:52	chekkaa	so for spawning monsters, pick a random point just outside the player's view, then spawn a mob based on what biome that point is in
2014-05-19 19:10:19	chekkaa	and the biome is calculated using how many biome-specific blocks are in a radius
2014-05-19 19:10:24	mythmon	chekkaa: sounds expensive.
2014-05-19 19:10:31	mythmon	but maybe.
2014-05-19 19:10:37	chekkaa	you could still do caching
2014-05-19 19:10:55	chekkaa	and you would only need to do it occasionally
2014-05-19 19:11:17	chekkaa	perhaps the "random" point could favor cached areas
2014-05-19 19:11:41	chekkaa	and just make sure there is at least one cached point in each direction
2014-05-19 19:12:42	chekkaa	also possible is choosing a random point and then just using the biome of the closest cached block if it's less than x blocks away
2014-05-19 19:13:05	chekkaa	that sounds better to me
2014-05-19 19:13:30	chekkaa	no need to add logic for making sure there are enough in each direction
2014-05-19 19:13:35	chekkaa	it happens naturally
2014-05-19 19:14:20	mythmon	still sounds expensive.
2014-05-19 19:14:26	mythmon	and complex
2014-05-19 19:14:26	chekkaa	really?
2014-05-19 19:14:32	mythmon	mainly complex, now.
2014-05-19 19:14:39	mythmon	why not just precompute it, and then update as needed?
2014-05-19 19:14:42	chekkaa	doesn't sound too complex to me
2014-05-19 19:15:12	chekkaa	precomputing would be almost as complex
2014-05-19 19:15:12	mythmon	you just described a system where the monster spawning has to have intimate knowledge of the cache.
2014-05-19 19:15:24	mythmon	that's tight coupling, which is bad.
2014-05-19 19:15:26	chekkaa	I took that back
2014-05-19 19:16:11	chekkaa	I feel like precomputing would be even more expensive
2014-05-19 19:16:18	mythmon	you do it during world gen.
2014-05-19 19:16:26	chekkaa	because you would have to constantly recalculate though
2014-05-19 19:16:34	chekkaa	whenever blocks spread
2014-05-19 19:16:38	chekkaa	or are broken or placed
2014-05-19 19:16:47	chekkaa	whereas no calculation is done with my system
2014-05-19 19:16:56	chekkaa	until it's needed
2014-05-19 19:17:00	chekkaa	and then only in one spot
2014-05-19 19:17:15	mythmon	but the world needs to know the biome stuff when things spread.
2014-05-19 19:17:32	chekkaa	I don't see what you mean
2014-05-19 19:17:33	mythmon	the biomes change as things spread.
2014-05-19 19:17:42	mythmon	as the hallow grows, so does the hallow biome.
2014-05-19 19:17:55	mythmon	so you have to update the regions that are marked as hallow biome as the blocks change.
2014-05-19 19:18:10	chekkaa	yes, but if you're doing it on the fly, there is no biome being recorded to change, unless you cache, in which case you just refresh it every so often
2014-05-19 19:18:15	mythmon	eh.
2014-05-19 19:18:18	mythmon	i would not implement your method.
2014-05-19 19:18:23	mythmon	i don't like it.
2014-05-19 19:18:33	chekkaa	hmm
2014-05-19 19:19:52	chekkaa	I just feel like precomputing would lead to a lot of wasted calculations that never get used
2014-05-19 19:20:18	chekkaa	if the other side of the world has hallow spreading, you would need to keep updating that constantly
2014-05-19 19:20:27	chekkaa	even if you weren't nearby
2014-05-19 19:20:42	chekkaa	that's why I only wanted to calculate nearby areas
2014-05-19 19:20:58	chekkaa	e.g. where the player roughly is and where mobs are spawning

2014-05-19 19:25:01	chekkaa	mythmon: I feel like there's some fundamental thing I am missing if it doesn't sound like a good idea
2014-05-19 19:38:57	mythmon	chekkaa: debounce.
2014-05-19 19:39:02	mythmon	you don't have to do it every change.
2014-05-19 19:39:09	chekkaa	debounce?
2014-05-19 19:39:22	mythmon	uh... it's a electronics term
2014-05-19 19:39:48	mythmon	but in this case a better word might be to aggregate events.
2014-05-19 19:39:54	mythmon	so you do it every 10 block changes, or something.
2014-05-19 19:40:18	chekkaa	but then you have to implement a block change queuing system
2014-05-19 19:40:48	chekkaa	that sounds super complex
2014-05-19 19:41:24	chekkaa	because presumably you mean 10 block changes that are close to each other
2014-05-19 19:41:43	chekkaa	otherwise you gain no benefits if they are not close
2014-05-19 19:42:52	chekkaa	I suppose you could divide the world up into squares
2014-05-19 19:42:57	chekkaa	and each square is a biome
2014-05-19 19:43:18	chekkaa	and have a queue for each square
2014-05-19 19:43:50	chekkaa	it would give some inconsistent behaviour on edges, but it might be less expensive

2014-05-20 09:55:24	jordane	heh. If this is based on my slides, then advanced is blob/tree/commits, organization of .git/, where git stores objects & how, weird crap you can do with git that the git client won't let you do

2014-05-20 10:01:28	edunham	the final third of the talk is how to do all this stuff with github and play well with others
2014-05-20 10:01:33	edunham	i really oughtta have a slide about git flow in there
2014-05-20 10:02:08	jnoah	edunham: i hope we don't go through the entire newbie talk
2014-05-20 10:02:15	jnoah	hence the 15/45 split
2014-05-20 10:02:48	terrellt	We did git flow for a while, until we had github.
2014-05-20 10:03:07	terrellt	Tags took the place of the holy master, and the develop branch poofed.
2014-05-20 10:24:05	pwnguin	(?P<ip>\S+)
2014-05-20 10:24:11	pwnguin	how is that a valid python regex?
2014-05-20 10:26:20	bryon	is this some kind of zen programming koan?
2014-05-20 10:26:33	pwnguin	well, its more like a word in a kaon
2014-05-20 10:26:44	pwnguin	REGEX="(?P<ip>\S+) \S+ \S+ \[(?P<date>.*?) (?P<timezone>.*?)\] \"\S+ (?P<path>.*?) \S+\" (?P<status>\S+) (?P<length>\S+) (?P\S+) \"(?P<referrer>.*?)\" \"(?P<user_agent>.*?)"
2014-05-20 10:27:05	bryon	no idea
2014-05-20 10:27:21	bryon	that looks like some mystical magic to me
2014-05-20 10:27:34	bryon	what means the ?P and \S?
2014-05-20 10:27:41	pwnguin	i'd love to know
2014-05-20 10:27:50	bryon	hahaha
2014-05-20 10:27:54	jnoah	S is the opposite of s
2014-05-20 10:27:55	bryon	ok, i feel less bad
2014-05-20 10:28:14	jnoah	not sure what ?P is though
2014-05-20 10:28:24	pwnguin	(?P<name>...) Creates a named capturing group.
2014-05-20 10:28:25	kennric	?P captures a group into the name <name> - so ?P<ip>\S+ captures \S+ and saves it in ip
2014-05-20 10:28:47	pwnguin	(?P=name)
2014-05-20 10:28:51	pwnguin	Matches whatever matched previously named group
2014-05-20 10:28:59	pwnguin	okay, so these are no longer regex
2014-05-20 10:29:08	pwnguin	or at least Regular Expressions
2014-05-20 10:29:32	kennric	Django does this in it's routes a lot, for sending the name as a param to the method the route points to
2014-05-20 10:29:45	terrellt	My gosh.
2014-05-20 10:29:57	pwnguin	http://www.pyregex.com/
2014-05-20 10:30:04	pwnguin	\S non-whitespace
2014-05-20 10:30:15	kennric	so all you Django devs really should have recognized that :)
2014-05-20 10:31:31	mathuin	... I can't think of the last time I used that feature. :-)
2014-05-20 10:31:42	pwnguin	log parsing!
2014-05-20 10:31:50	terrellt	mathuin: Named captures?
2014-05-20 10:31:57	terrellt	Or non-whitespace.
2014-05-20 10:32:51	mathuin	Named captures.
2014-05-20 10:33:16	kennric	mathuin: look in pgd_search/urls.py
2014-05-20 10:33:19	terrellt	Ruby just uses ?<name> instead of ?P<name>, but yeah, I don't usually use them either.
2014-05-20 10:33:20	mathuin	I tend to use positive regexen rather than negative ones.  I'd rather specify what something should be than what something shouldn't be.
2014-05-20 10:33:52	kennric	yeah, capturing \S doesn't feel nice
2014-05-20 10:35:02	mathuin	kennric: not saying it's not there, just saying I can't remember when I last used it.  I tend to use numbered groups like s/[0-9]* [a-z]*/\2 \1/
2014-05-20 10:37:09	kennric	if you have no idea of the nature of the thing you are trying to capture, maybe you should pause for a moment and think before just grabbing whatever it is and then trying to figure it out
2014-05-20 10:37:42	kennric	though I have certainly been in situations where you really couldn't be sure what you were going to get
2014-05-20 10:37:53	terrellt	REGEX="<?P<stuff>.*)"
2014-05-20 10:38:41	terrellt	s/</(
2014-05-20 10:50:15	pwnguin	print re.match('196.196.20.243','(?P<ip>\S+)')

2014-05-20 17:37:26	edunham	drkitty: which one?
2014-05-20 17:37:31	edunham	i personally just google it
2014-05-20 17:38:04	drkitty	I'm not really sure what to google. I'm looking for the equivalent of COMM111 at Spokane Falls Community College.
2014-05-20 17:38:43	edunham	https://www.google.com/#q=oregon+state+spokane+community+college+course+equivalency
2014-05-20 17:40:38	drkitty	I'm not seeing it there. Calvin Hughes was able to look it up somewhere but I didn't write down the classes and I don't remember how he got there.

2014-05-20 18:37:50	bryon	yeah, makes sense
2014-05-20 18:38:27	bryon	i think for osu to determine course equivalency, they would need a syllabus & learning outcomes for that course

2014-05-21 10:12:42	drkitty	How about `sorted(xs, lambda x: int(ipaddr.IPV6Address(x)))` or something?
2014-05-21 10:12:55	drkitty	oops
2014-05-21 10:13:05	edunham	yeah that
2014-05-21 10:13:06	drkitty	`sorted(xs, lambda x: int(ipaddr.IPV6Address(x.ip_address)))`
2014-05-21 10:13:13	edunham	derp
2014-05-21 10:13:15	drkitty	(using the helpful ipaddr library)
2014-05-21 10:13:23	edunham	drkitty++ for remembering the names of things
2014-05-21 10:13:30	drkitty	heh
2014-05-21 10:13:36	mythmon	haroldhues: what format do you have the ipv6 addresses in?
2014-05-21 10:13:46	haroldhues	mythmon: Strings
2014-05-21 10:13:52	akeym	haroldhues: you should come over to the library and work with the rest of the student crew :)
2014-05-21 10:13:52	edunham	additionally the lambda x bit can be some arbitrary function for comparing the address strings
2014-05-21 10:14:14	mythmon	haroldhues: always expanded? or do you have things like ::1 ?
2014-05-21 10:14:28	edunham	writing that comparator would be the hardest part
2014-05-21 10:14:37	murrown	akeym: well we don't want our ipv6 addresses to be strings
2014-05-21 10:14:41	drkitty	Ah, if they're expanded you could just remove the colons and sort on the resulting strings.
2014-05-21 10:14:51	drkitty	as long as each part is four digits
2014-05-21 10:14:57	haroldhues	mythmon: No many of them have :: stuffs
2014-05-21 10:15:06	akeym	murrown: what are you talking about

2014-05-21 10:16:16	murrown	I know that, I thought we were just scouting for talent
2014-05-21 10:16:24	drkitty	haroldhues: A pair of 64-bit integers.

2014-05-21 10:17:50	haroldhues	akeym: That would be cool :)
2014-05-21 10:18:22	murrown	yeah we have to use 64-bit integers because we're using MySQL, I think
2014-05-21 10:18:40	murrown	I think if we moved to postgres we could use just one field? And maybe it depends on the version of Django, too
2014-05-21 10:18:59	akeym	we can't have a 128bit integer in mysql
2014-05-21 10:19:18	akeym	and it doesn't handle bit(128) the way we'd like (but that has to do with the ORM i thought?)
2014-05-21 10:20:20	murrown	well I don't know about that
2014-05-21 10:21:44	edunham	irdan: also `.. slide::` allows you to have slide without title
2014-05-21 10:24:22	edunham	irdan++ good talk
2014-05-21 10:24:57	drkitty	akeym: It's mostly mysqldb's (the driver's) fault.
2014-05-21 10:26:01	akeym	yeah, i seem to remember that
2014-05-21 10:26:12	akeym	(which would not make it the ORM, but ..yeah)

2014-05-21 11:17:52	fyrexus	mythmon: My router's wifi tends to just stop working every now and then, and lately it has become a lot more often.
2014-05-21 11:18:05	mythmon	fyrexus: why do you think that is a dns attack?
2014-05-21 11:18:20	fyrexus	My hypothesis is a trojan, too many people on the network, or some attacker. OR just it's a piece of crap modem from Goodwill.
2014-05-21 11:18:45	fyrexus	I was talking about dns attacks last night with a friend, that's the only reason I thought that it could be that.
2014-05-21 11:19:00	fyrexus	But we have a box or something for the fiber optics, so maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions
2014-05-21 11:19:22	 *	fyrexus is natually peeved that they have to reset their router so often
2014-05-21 11:19:36	mythmon	fyrexus: are you sure it is the router's wifi crapping out?
2014-05-21 11:19:44	mythmon	do you lose connection, or does the internet just not work?
2014-05-21 11:19:52	fyrexus	Yeah, I've used numberous wifi enabled devices

2014-05-21 11:20:08	fyrexus	but Wi-Fi is iffy.
2014-05-21 11:20:12	fyrexus	at best...
2014-05-21 11:20:15	mythmon	the first things i would look at are power and heat
2014-05-21 11:20:42	fyrexus	of the router or my devices?
2014-05-21 11:20:46	mythmon	the router.
2014-05-21 11:21:09	mythmon	i've had routers that get really flaky when they over heat, and i've had routers that need reset when they have shitty power.

2014-05-21 19:23:34	PBJmonster	it's challenging, but if you're really into computation it's quite fun
2014-05-21 19:23:59	chekkaa	can anyone just take it?
2014-05-21 19:24:47	chekkaa	PBJmonster: how much harder is it than the regular one?
2014-05-21 19:25:09	PBJmonster	I'm not too sure, I'm looking at the regular course website right now
2014-05-21 19:27:59	PBJmonster	Hmm, I took the class 18 months ago, so I don't exactly remember all the material covered
2014-05-21 19:28:16	PBJmonster	but what I do remember is that we were given overall harder problems on the same content
2014-05-21 19:28:52	PBJmonster	and Dr. Cull expects students to interact more and research problems online
2014-05-21 19:29:18	PBJmonster	grading is a black box
2014-05-21 19:29:41	PBJmonster	I'm not making too good of an appeal for it, am I/
2014-05-21 19:29:42	PBJmonster	?
2014-05-21 19:31:42	chekkaa	not really
2014-05-21 19:31:45	chekkaa	lol
2014-05-21 19:32:05	chekkaa	I'm not feeling super confident about it
2014-05-21 19:33:00	PBJmonster	admittedly, the content will probably have a clearer presentation as the Honors course doesn't use a real "textbook" but instead uses the best introduction novel to computation
2014-05-21 19:34:26	PBJmonster	the honors section will challenge your own ability to keep track of the material, so you won't feel spoon-fed at all
2014-05-21 19:39:32	PBJmonster	the regular section seems to be mostly about preparing you for the compilers class with language details, whereas in the honors section you cover some computational complexity

2014-05-22 12:55:47	spectralsun	lrr: default
2014-05-22 12:55:55	lrr	because you have weehcat.noftify.irc.irc....

2014-05-22 12:57:01	spectralsun	maybe later
2014-05-22 12:57:13	spectralsun	id rather things not break
2014-05-22 12:57:26	spectralsun	i think my autojoin channel list is set up for irc.freenode.net

2014-05-22 13:04:40	spectralsun	mythmon: can I make firefox store bookmarks directly to bookmarks menu?
2014-05-22 13:04:47	spectralsun	instead of unsorted bookmarks
2014-05-22 13:04:55	mythmon	spectralsun: idk
2014-05-22 13:08:06	drkitty	spectralsun: You can drag the globe or lock on the left side of the address bar onto the bookmarks menu.
2014-05-22 13:08:23	drkitty	I probably have an old version, though.
2014-05-22 13:08:32	drkitty	29.0
2014-05-22 13:09:11	drkitty	I don't know if that answers your question, though.
2014-05-22 13:09:24	mythmon	drkitty: thats... what?
2014-05-22 13:09:27	spectralsun	this is what I use:
2014-05-22 13:09:40	spectralsun	http://i.imgur.com/Gd3cIK6.png
2014-05-22 13:09:45	spectralsun	bottom left of my firefox
2014-05-22 13:09:47	spectralsun	and when i bookmark:
2014-05-22 13:10:30	spectralsun	hmm cant really screenshot that
2014-05-22 13:10:33	drkitty	mythmon: I don't even know. Never mind.
2014-05-22 13:11:21	drkitty	sorry
2014-05-22 13:11:36	spectralsun	drkitty: no worries
2014-05-22 13:12:17	mythmon	spectralsun: the way i use bookmarks is as hints to the awesome bar engine.
2014-05-22 13:12:25	spectralsun	mythmon: ah
2014-05-22 13:12:37	spectralsun	I should probably start using pentadactyl for this.
2014-05-22 13:12:47	spectralsun	which btw, if anyone cares, is much better than vimperator IMHO
2014-05-22 13:14:25	mythmon	i have a few manually sorted bookmarks, but almost all of them are in the unsorted menu.
2014-05-22 13:14:27	mythmon	some of them have tags.
2014-05-22 13:14:53	mythmon	then if I want to find something, I type useful words into the awesome bar and it usually finds my bookmarks.
2014-05-22 13:14:58	mythmon	or something else i was looking for.
2014-05-22 13:16:38	spectralsun	ah
2014-05-22 13:16:43	spectralsun	I like to sort mine
2014-05-22 13:16:56	spectralsun	because I browse *a lot* of useful pages
2014-05-22 13:17:08	spectralsun	and don't really commit *a lot* of things to my memory
2014-05-22 13:17:52	spectralsun	but i could probably get by with what you described
2014-05-22 13:18:02	spectralsun	pentadactyl does keyword bookmark loading
2014-05-22 13:18:56	mythmon	what kind of stuff do you have bookmarked?
2014-05-22 13:20:28	spectralsun	mythmon: all the things
2014-05-22 13:20:46	mythmon	if you bookmark everything, then nothing is important.
2014-05-22 13:20:48	spectralsun	documentation, guides, interesting sites, direct links to reply memes, etc
2014-05-22 13:21:11	 *	spectralsun just started using firefox sync
2014-05-22 13:21:42	mythmon	let firefox track your history. sync it so you don't lose it. keep it between devices, between laptops, between profiles.
2014-05-22 13:22:01	mythmon	frecency and tagged bookmarks are wonderful.
2014-05-22 13:22:52	spectralsun	frecency?
2014-05-22 13:23:17	mythmon	frequency and recency. It's the primary metric of the awesomebar.
2014-05-22 13:23:53	mythmon	and then there are boosts for things like bookmarks, matching tags, how close what you typed is to the actual url/title, etc.

2014-05-22 14:46:12	chekkaa	the internet seems to think they're a lot better than pygame
2014-05-22 14:46:20	chekkaa	and much more performant
2014-05-22 14:56:41	chekkaa	though now I need to decide between them
2014-05-22 14:56:58	chekkaa	supposedly cocos is easier
2014-05-22 14:59:42	drkitty	People keep saying shell.onid.o.e is going away soon.
2014-05-22 14:59:45	drkitty	Is that actually true?
2014-05-22 15:00:05	jnoah	cocos would be my suggestions. but i have not gone into either too deeply
2014-05-22 15:48:05	edunham	drkitty: not any people i've been listening to...
2014-05-22 15:48:12	edunham	then again you're likelier to know the inside gossip on that than i am

2014-05-23 14:33:58	mythmon	uh
2014-05-23 14:34:43	mythmon	our deploy process is something like clone, apply settings, build step, copy to nfs, kick web heads
2014-05-23 14:34:56	mythmon	with some more steps and some hand waving.

2014-05-23 14:44:30	terrellt	Our apps have two different deploy strategies. First one clones, sets up, migrates db if necessary, minifies JS/CSS, and builds a symlink. Second one checks out from a shared repo directory, migrates db/minifies/etc, then rsyncs to a release directory, and builds a symlink.
2014-05-23 14:45:16	terrellt	Both kick the web heads, obviously.
2014-05-23 14:45:33	terrellt	As well as any supporting processes.
2014-05-23 15:19:01	chance	yeah
2014-05-23 15:19:11	chance	we've got this problem where we tried hard to make it like 1 command install
2014-05-23 15:19:16	chance	but web apps arent that simple
2014-05-23 15:19:24	chance	especially when settings are contained in a python module itself
2014-05-23 15:19:53	terrellt	Abstract your deploy into one command.
2014-05-23 15:20:17	terrellt	Either share configuration via symlinks or, even better, use environment variables.
2014-05-23 15:20:49	terrellt	Our deploy process is that, but we use Capistrano, so I just hit "cap deploy"

2014-05-23 18:36:01	mythmon	there is really only one jovian planet.
2014-05-23 18:36:17	chance	no, there are 4
2014-05-23 18:36:20	bryon	touche, mythmon
2014-05-23 18:36:30	chance	the gaseous planets are jovian, at least thats how we've learned it
2014-05-23 18:36:39	bryon	i believe mythmon is referring to Jupiter, named for Jove
2014-05-23 18:36:42	chance	jupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune.
2014-05-23 18:36:51	mythmon	ah
2014-05-23 18:36:56	chance	ah
2014-05-23 18:36:58	mythmon	i'm not an astronomer.

2014-05-23 18:37:08	chance	i dont know what jovian means except for what wikipedia just brought up
2014-05-23 18:37:13	bryon	but yes, gas giants are collectively referred to as jovian planets
2014-05-23 18:37:17	chance	kinda just assumed it meant "gaseous somethings"
2014-05-23 18:37:23	mythmon	interesting.
2014-05-23 18:37:55	chance	median score was 76.5 and highest was 95.8, with 5 in 90-100 and 5 in 80-89
2014-05-23 18:37:56	bryon	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)
2014-05-23 18:38:05	chance	16 between 70-79 and a total of 41
2014-05-23 18:38:10	chance	so not so bad
2014-05-23 18:39:15	chance	the prof is super cool, its online, but he's totally about learning, more so than grade

2014-05-23 18:44:26	mythmon	nice
2014-05-23 18:44:34	chance	but the class itself is "Disney: Gender, Race, Empire"

2014-05-23 18:45:56	chance	one project is called "my side of the story" where you write an essay/series of letters/dairy entries/make a short film/ect from the perspective of one of the villains in one of the movies we've watched

2014-05-23 18:48:31	chance	scar, lion king
2014-05-23 18:50:51	chance	at that point we had watched cinderella, sleeping beauty, snow white, little mermaid, beauty and the beast, aladdin and the lion king
2014-05-23 18:50:59	chance	some good villains/bad people in there
2014-05-23 18:52:32	pwnguin	you could be all 'what qualifications does simba have, other than being born with a silver spoon in his mouth? yadda yadda yay democracy'
2014-05-23 18:54:25	chance	well scar did kill his father
2014-05-23 18:54:30	chance	so
2014-05-23 18:55:15	pwnguin	and maybe something about white people in charge of africa
2014-05-23 18:55:58	mythmon	lrr: that's not how certs work.
2014-05-23 18:56:15	chance	pwnguin: yeah that was certainly a point i made
2014-05-23 18:56:22	chance	well kind of
2014-05-23 18:56:27	chance	those poor hyenas..
2014-05-23 19:03:04	mythmon	chance: are any of the disney movies you studied actually good, in terms of gender, race and empire?
2014-05-23 19:03:36	chance	id say that Beauty and the Beast was actually relatively good in terms of gender
2014-05-23 19:03:57	mythmon	yeah, ok.
2014-05-23 19:03:59	chance	while beast treats belle poorly in the beginning, its one of few movies where the male protagonist actually has little power over his destiny.
2014-05-23 19:04:52	mythmon	and his poor treatment is identified as a problem by most (all?) of the characters, so that' good.
2014-05-23 19:05:18	chance	in most Disney movies, the female always needs saving, and are helpless, the male needs to save them and does. In B&B he needs her to save him, and he actually gives up the possiblity to be freed from the spell by letting Belle leave the castle, even though they were just becoming so close
2014-05-23 19:05:39	mythmon	yeah
2014-05-23 19:05:54	chance	his treatment is identified, he is very sterotypical male rage, but i think its okay since its actually quite short lived
2014-05-23 19:06:14	chance	he very quickly becomes a polite guy looking to get that curse lifted
2014-05-23 19:06:58	chance	i like this class, it really taught me to look at media with a different lense
2014-05-23 19:07:27	chance	its easy to buy into the idea that these things are good for us when that's exactly what they want you to believe
2014-05-23 19:07:50	chance	but the subtle nuances in these films kind of open your eyes to whats wrong with our culture.

2014-05-23 22:44:49	chance	also multi-user takes too much memory
2014-05-23 22:45:05	chance	my mini swaps when me and my gf are both logged in and runnign chrome, w/ 8Gb of ram

2014-05-24 12:24:13	 *	jnoah doesn't know
2014-05-24 12:31:21	spectralsun	jnoah: hmm
2014-05-24 12:31:36	spectralsun	an ideal solution would be a script that can SSH into my box
2014-05-24 12:31:45	spectralsun	and report back DMs and PMs
2014-05-24 12:32:01	spectralsun	it would be wonderful to see it in the form of
2014-05-24 12:32:16	spectralsun	#osu-lug(1), somefriend(3)
2014-05-24 12:35:53	mythmon	spectralsun: weechat relay can run over ssl and be password protectd.
2014-05-24 12:39:52	spectralsun	mythmon: but can it do that ^
2014-05-24 12:39:55	spectralsun	dunst is cool
2014-05-24 12:39:57	spectralsun	but
2014-05-24 12:39:59	spectralsun	not really what im after
2014-05-24 12:40:02	spectralsun	because i go afk
2014-05-24 12:40:05	spectralsun	and come back
2014-05-24 12:40:08	spectralsun	i want to see it in my conkey
2014-05-24 12:40:11	spectralsun	conky*
2014-05-24 12:40:20	spectralsun	like how i see it in weechat, but a little slimmer
2014-05-24 12:40:23	spectralsun	#osu-lug(1), somefriend(3)
2014-05-24 12:41:09	mythmon	spectralsun: the relay protocol is much lower level than that.
2014-05-24 12:41:14	mythmon	you could build that with relay.
2014-05-24 12:41:32	spectralsun	mythmon: ok
2014-05-24 12:41:40	spectralsun	mythmon: I am just wondering about state
2014-05-24 12:41:52	spectralsun	mythmon: I got the impression relay would be more of an emitting of notifications
2014-05-24 12:41:59	mythmon	no
2014-05-24 12:42:10	mythmon	relay is something that can be used to build an entire weechat client.
2014-05-24 12:42:16	spectralsun	mythmon: cool
2014-05-24 12:42:21	mythmon	i use it to emit notifications.
2014-05-24 12:42:38	spectralsun	mythmon: and I can write something in python to connect over ssh?
2014-05-24 12:42:44	spectralsun	and then use the replay
2014-05-24 12:42:46	spectralsun	relay*
2014-05-24 12:42:48	mythmon	spectralsun: you don't need ssh
2014-05-24 12:42:54	spectralsun	mythmon: I dont want to open more ports
2014-05-24 12:43:11	mythmon	then sure, you can make something that makes a port forward and then connects through that.
2014-05-24 12:43:25	spectralsun	mythmon: good idea :)
2014-05-24 12:44:05	mythmon	the code for that is pretty easy if you understand how to do ssh tunnels normally.
2014-05-24 12:44:20	mythmon	just start subprocesses.
2014-05-24 12:45:14	spectralsun	yup
2014-05-24 12:45:26	spectralsun	I will use ssh by itself to forward 7001 locally
2014-05-24 12:45:33	chance	i like znc
2014-05-24 12:45:39	chance	it does all this
2014-05-24 12:45:42	chance	kind of
2014-05-24 12:45:50	chance	not the intregration with conky/things
2014-05-24 12:45:52	chance	but it could
2014-05-24 12:46:38	mythmon	chance: ....nop?
2014-05-24 12:46:43	mythmon	s/nop/no/
2014-05-24 12:46:43	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: chance: ....no?
2014-05-24 12:47:09	mythmon	chance: znc does none of the things we are talking about.
2014-05-24 12:47:16	chance	he wants to see that hes got PMs after going afk?
2014-05-24 12:47:19	chance	or something
2014-05-24 12:47:21	mythmon	no
2014-05-24 12:47:27	mythmon	he wants notifications outside of the client.
2014-05-24 12:47:42	chance	znc does that.
2014-05-24 12:47:49	chance	i can get notifications to my phone
2014-05-24 12:47:50	mythmon	integration into conky is everything that is desired.
2014-05-24 12:48:01	mythmon	chance: no, NMA (or whatever app you are using) does that.
2014-05-24 12:48:03	chance	its just about changing where your getting them
2014-05-24 12:48:51	chance	znc-push supports a ton of netification  services, and also custom URL GET requests
2014-05-24 12:48:56	chance	notification services*
2014-05-24 12:49:10	spectralsun	mythmon: I think I will probably write a little something
2014-05-24 12:49:19	chance	conky would just need to be accessible from znc
2014-05-24 12:49:22	spectralsun	because i think i may want to turn on any message notification for certain channels
2014-05-24 12:49:24	chance	to znc*
2014-05-24 12:49:28	spectralsun	i want that fine-grained control
2014-05-24 12:49:30	mythmon	chance: i'm feeling unreasonably unhappy at you because you are claiming technical superiority where i don't believe you understand the problem at hand and i don't believe the technical superiority exists.
2014-05-24 12:49:57	chance	i dont claim technical superiority, where are you getting that impression? Im suggesting something that might do what he wants..
2014-05-24 12:50:17	spectralsun	chance: I have a solution, just need a better client.
2014-05-24 12:50:20	mythmon	this is not notifications. this is about making micro-clients. this isn't weechat (or znc) pushing notifications, it is things pulling data from the daemon.
2014-05-24 12:51:37	chance	oh, k so he wants to be able to send/recieve everything from this 'microclient'?
2014-05-24 12:51:44	spectralsun	chance: no.
2014-05-24 12:52:33	spectralsun	chance: i use screen + weechat. i want to see DMs and PMs in my conky bar. this is my conky bar: http://i.imgur.com/BKi6TPY.png

2014-05-24 12:53:10	chance	right
2014-05-24 12:53:12	chance	thats what i thought
2014-05-24 12:53:24	HardParting	You are literally the first person I have ever met since the 90s can make that claim =D
2014-05-24 12:53:52	spectralsun	HardParting: I traded a gameboy cartridge for the album
2014-05-24 12:53:56	spectralsun	when I was in 2nd grade
2014-05-24 12:54:40	chance	see, with znc i could just see you setting a custom URL endpoint that znc could GET to, with the data you want, and that custom url endpoint could simply be a local ssh tunnel to your computer. your computer runs a local service which handles the request and puts it into conky
2014-05-24 12:54:51	spectralsun	chance: I already thought of that.
2014-05-24 12:54:53	HardParting	lol, i was in middle school when it came out, but yeah I love this album
2014-05-24 12:55:02	spectralsun	chance: and literaly suggested that exact model.
2014-05-24 12:55:10	spectralsun	i might not have done it in chan
2014-05-24 12:55:13	chance	ive talked to quite a few people who have irc things like what you guys were talking about
2014-05-24 12:55:29	spectralsun	chance: sure, i can roll one out right now
2014-05-24 12:55:30	chance	not conky but gnome panels and such
2014-05-24 12:55:35	spectralsun	im just looking for a specific thing
2014-05-24 12:56:00	spectralsun	conky ready, specific formatting, fine grained control, reasonable security
2014-05-24 12:56:20	HardParting	Could you just poll the log files?
2014-05-24 12:56:33	spectralsun	HardParting: thats not quite moon scale.

2014-05-24 14:08:43	mythmon	well, 27%

2014-05-24 14:08:55	spectralsun	mythmon: its also the factored percentage
2014-05-24 14:08:59	spectralsun	not the real

2014-05-24 14:09:18	spectralsun	you know how your battery only stores so much
2014-05-24 14:09:23	spectralsun	and that gets less and less each time
2014-05-24 14:09:23	mythmon	it's compared to actual capacity, not design capacity?
2014-05-24 14:09:26	spectralsun	right
2014-05-24 14:09:29	mythmon	cool
2014-05-24 14:09:38	spectralsun	it will always show you at 100%
2014-05-24 14:09:42	spectralsun	when "fully charged"
2014-05-24 14:09:44	mythmon	nice
2014-05-24 14:10:01	spectralsun	100% -> really like 87% when i look at i3status in the terminal
2014-05-24 14:10:16	spectralsun	I prefer the other number
2014-05-24 14:10:24	spectralsun	I like to watch my battery die

2014-05-24 14:11:14	mythmon	sad
2014-05-24 14:11:24	spectralsun	once it goes below 80 im going to replace it

2014-05-24 14:12:11	mythmon	well, maybe not soldered in, idk about that, but not user replaceable.

2014-05-24 14:14:46	mythmon	edunham: the 2nd gen x1 carbon.
2014-05-24 14:15:49	mythmon	as opposed to spectralsun's 1st gen. I think the 1st gen has a more normal keyboard and has buttons on the trackpad still
2014-05-24 14:16:16	spectralsun	mythmon: you got an x1??? :>
2014-05-24 14:16:20	spectralsun	a*

2014-05-24 14:16:34	mythmon	spectralsun: yeah
2014-05-24 14:16:42	spectralsun	mythmon: so the one with light-up f-keys
2014-05-24 14:16:46	mythmon	yeah
2014-05-24 14:16:51	spectralsun	hows that working out
2014-05-24 14:16:54	spectralsun	with linux and such
2014-05-24 14:17:14	mythmon	they work fine as normal fkeys. the default mode is the one you would want if you only got one.
2014-05-24 14:17:25	spectralsun	volume control?
2014-05-24 14:17:27	spectralsun	in linux?
2014-05-24 14:17:31	mythmon	when i suspend they go away, but linux 3.15 has a patch for that.
2014-05-24 14:17:35	spectralsun	media player control?
2014-05-24 14:17:49	mythmon	those are on other "pages" of the light up screen
2014-05-24 14:17:57	spectralsun	so..no?
2014-05-24 14:17:57	@hamper	spectralsun: yes!
2014-05-24 14:18:00	spectralsun	>_<
2014-05-24 14:18:04	mythmon	i expect 3.15 will also have the stuff to change pages too.

2014-05-26 23:19:55	muricula	The machines were pretty much the same, except the mac had a better resolution and it probbly lighter
2014-05-26 23:20:03	chekkaa	yeah, but they're sold with windows

2014-05-26 23:20:45	mythmon	i never noticed.
2014-05-26 23:20:47	chekkaa	if that matters
2014-05-26 23:21:07	mythmon	imo getting a mac solely to put linux on it is silly.
2014-05-26 23:21:19	chekkaa	but if you're not paying for it, why not?
2014-05-26 23:21:33	chekkaa	it's still nice hardware
2014-05-26 23:21:40	chekkaa	except for the trackpad
2014-05-26 23:21:42	mythmon	iyss
2014-05-26 23:21:46	chekkaa	but everyone is screwing those up these days
2014-05-26 23:22:17	chekkaa	laser mice these days work on everything

2014-05-26 23:22:42	mythmon	that's funny, because most people who get macs love the trackpad.
2014-05-26 23:23:53	chekkaa	maybe it takes some getting used to, but I've used them for a writing class for hours and still couldn't figure out how to right click reliably
2014-05-26 23:24:09	mythmon	two finger click.

2014-05-26 23:25:22	chekkaa	um, windows I think
2014-05-26 23:25:25	mythmon	ah
2014-05-26 23:25:29	chekkaa	is that it?
2014-05-26 23:25:33	mythmon	the trackpad support in windows isn't quite as good.
2014-05-26 23:25:38	chekkaa	ah
2014-05-26 23:25:49	mythmon	the actual hardware of the trackpad isn't that unique, it's the drivers and other software.
2014-05-26 23:26:04	chekkaa	I still like having physical buttons though
2014-05-26 23:26:13	mythmon	for example, i think i like the hardware of the x1 carbon2 better than a macbook pro's trackpad
2014-05-26 23:26:15	chekkaa	removes all possibility of moving the mouse when you meant to click
2014-05-26 23:26:23	chekkaa	and I also love my middle click button :3
2014-05-26 23:26:28	mythmon	a good clickpad doesn't have that problem.
2014-05-26 23:26:40	mythmon	there are a lot of bad clickpads thouhg.
2014-05-26 23:27:01	chekkaa	maybe I have just never experienced a good pad + good drivers before then
2014-05-26 23:27:31	chekkaa	though what do people do about middle click?
2014-05-26 23:27:44	mythmon	osx doesn't have them natively.
2014-05-26 23:27:59	chekkaa	oh
2014-05-26 23:28:05	mythmon	i mean, it has the concept.
2014-05-26 23:28:10	mythmon	but a mbp has no way to generate them.
2014-05-26 23:28:14	chekkaa	oh
2014-05-26 23:28:19	mythmon	in windows, this laptop puts a virtual middle click in an area of the clickpad where there are some bumps.
2014-05-26 23:28:36	mythmon	in my setup in linux, threefinger click is middle click.
2014-05-26 23:28:42	chekkaa	also, how to click and drag?
2014-05-26 23:28:46	mythmon	it's actually less finicky than the two finger click for right click.
2014-05-26 23:29:14	mythmon	on a good trackpad, click with one thing, and slide with the other.
2014-05-26 23:29:32	mythmon	usually click with a thumb, move with the index finger attached to it, just like you would with buttons.
2014-05-26 23:29:50	chekkaa	:o
2014-05-26 23:30:07	mythmon	osx does that. this laptop does it too.
2014-05-26 23:30:19	chekkaa	er, wait
2014-05-26 23:30:24	chekkaa	click, or hold?
2014-05-26 23:30:37	chekkaa	does a hold even register as anything?
2014-05-26 23:30:40	mythmon	i press and hold with my thumb. then i slide a finger across the surface.
2014-05-26 23:30:41	nibalizer	computers keep getting shittier
2014-05-26 23:31:50	mythmon	a hold registers as holding down whatever mouse click event you triggered.
2014-05-26 23:32:21	mythmon	now, there isn't any good way to do both a left and a right click at once, but i haven't needed to do that outside games.
2014-05-26 23:32:26	mythmon	and who games with a trackpad.
2014-05-26 23:32:32	chekkaa	fair enough

2014-05-27 10:23:41	relud	also also, thinkpads have a lot more usb ports
2014-05-27 10:23:57	mythmon	relud: well, some of them.
2014-05-27 10:24:11	relud	also also also, thinkpas common have real ethernet ports, with real linux support. thunderbolt ethernet isn't hotpluggable outside osx
2014-05-27 10:24:38	relud	true, there are thinkpads which break every one of my comments.

2014-05-27 10:25:12	relud	mythmon: haven't used the different kb
2014-05-27 10:25:22	relud	it's more of a 'not osx keyboard'
2014-05-27 10:25:27	mythmon	ah
2014-05-27 10:25:35	relud	because osx keyboards tell my hands to use osx shortcuts, in part

2014-05-27 10:32:06	Ac-town	dont need the camera
2014-05-27 10:32:17	bramwelt	Ac-town be trollin'
2014-05-27 10:32:20	Ac-town	I be not
2014-05-27 10:32:20	relud	at mozilla you do
2014-05-27 10:32:33	Ac-town	I get on hangouts and dont have a working camera
2014-05-27 10:32:36	relud	for video conferencing, which you should be doing at least once weekly
2014-05-27 10:32:38	Ac-town	okay with me
2014-05-27 10:32:58	chekkaa	is video required?
2014-05-27 10:33:03	chekkaa	seems unnecessary to me
2014-05-27 10:33:33	Ac-town	just tell them you dont want your freedoms restricted by spying
2014-05-27 10:33:39	Ac-town	so you dont have a working camera
2014-05-27 10:34:08	bramwelt	Until that one day where you think, "Hey it would be cool if I video chatted with my old friend". Oh wait...I guess I'll just go shell out $30 dollars for a piece of hardware I already have, but can't use.
2014-05-27 10:34:31	Ac-town	but do you need to see them? doubt it
2014-05-27 10:34:51	relud	chekkaa: you are kind of expected to get your vidyo client working, and have a reliable means of video chatting with your remote coworkers.
2014-05-27 10:35:24	relud	but you can technically phone call into meetings
2014-05-27 10:36:01	mythmon	it's not good.
2014-05-27 10:36:13	mythmon	the phoning in.
2014-05-27 10:36:52	relud	both in a "don't do it" way and a "phone in support is shit" way

2014-05-27 10:38:06	chekkaa	what's wrong with phones, besides the bad call quality?
2014-05-27 10:40:54	mythmon	bad call quality, awkward setup, no video.
2014-05-27 10:41:07	mythmon	less reliable.
2014-05-27 10:41:47	mythmon	it's easier to have a conversation among 4 people with video chat than with audio chat.
2014-05-27 10:41:49	chekkaa	I just don't see the benefit of video calling vs voice only
2014-05-27 10:41:58	chekkaa	oh, ok
2014-05-27 10:41:59	relud	people like seeing your face, because you're an intern, and they don't know you
2014-05-27 10:42:35	chekkaa	I guess that makes sense if its with new people
2014-05-27 10:42:36	mythmon	video chat between two people is a luxury. when there are 20 people on a call, it's vital.
2014-05-27 10:42:56	chekkaa	mythmon: because you can't tell voices apart, or what?
2014-05-27 10:43:22	mythmon	chekkaa: that, and it's hard to do the thing people are good at where you know when it's your turn to talk.
2014-05-27 10:45:42	relud	bramwelt: nice video

2014-05-27 11:10:32	mathuin	I am thinking of trying Hangouts as an alternative to making everyone come in to Corvallis for officer meetings for the food science club.  Has LUG tried this?
2014-05-27 11:11:28	edunham	mathuin: we haven't used them for officer meetings
2014-05-27 11:12:06	edunham	we used to stream meetings but there was so little interest that my laziness prevailed
2014-05-27 11:12:20	mathuin	At one meeting last term, we had one officer do the Hangout thing and we passed the laptop around so she could look at us when we talked, but that was annoying.
2014-05-27 11:13:41	kennric	mathuin: there are issues with hangouts for anyone not using one of the ordained operating systems
2014-05-27 11:15:09	kennric	it is not implemented in an open-source/open standards kind of way, either
2014-05-27 11:15:24	edunham	mathuin: set the laptop at the end of the table with a webcam so they can see everyone
2014-05-27 11:15:29	edunham	use a big screen if you can
2014-05-27 11:16:13	bkero	https://vline.com/
2014-05-27 11:16:26	kennric	oh, and privacy
2014-05-27 11:16:30	mathuin	I agree re: screen.  The table we used was round, so only three of the eight were in view.
2014-05-27 11:17:28	mathuin	re: ordained  Yes, I have had trouble, but so far Ubuntu and Windows seem to interoperate pretty well with hangouts.  There's also a mobile-desktop issue that I think is still unresolved.
2014-05-27 11:19:28	kennric	vline looks interesting
2014-05-27 11:19:50	bkero	It's webrtc.
2014-05-27 11:19:58	kennric	oh, and people have to have a google+ account for hangouts, another sticking point in some circles
2014-05-27 11:20:30	kennric	bkero: as it should be
2014-05-27 11:20:56	mathuin	kennric: now that every ONID has a Google account, they also get a Google+ account, so that's a technically solved problem.
2014-05-27 11:21:01	mathuin	Socially, well, different question.
2014-05-27 11:21:44	mythmon	bkero: does vline do n^2 multi conferencing? or do they have a router? or are the very very clever?
2014-05-27 11:22:00	kennric	not that I am saying hangouts are awful and politically/ethically fraught and you should look for open solutions instead, or anything, just making observations.
2014-05-27 11:22:08	bkero	mythmon: unsure
2014-05-27 11:22:47	mythmon	i've tried appear.in and ... another one. they both suffered from n^2 performance problems, which is sad.
2014-05-27 11:23:04	mathuin	kennric: of course!  and many of your issues are totally valid -- but I will have a much, much easier time helping the mostly non-technical folks in that circle with making Hangouts go than a separate solution.
2014-05-27 11:23:21	mythmon	edunham: by the way, did i tell you i figured out my G+ performance problem?
2014-05-27 11:23:49	kennric	mathuin: I am not so sure, vline is pretty point-and-click
2014-05-27 11:24:33	mathuin	if it's supported on Mac/Linux/Windows with whatever web browser those folks use, sure.  Will they have to install additional drivers?  I haven't tried vline yet.
2014-05-27 11:24:47	edunham	mythmon: no, how'd you fix i?
2014-05-27 11:24:48	edunham	*it
2014-05-27 11:25:05	mythmon	edunham: enable virtualization acceleration.
2014-05-27 11:25:12	mythmon	mathuin: modern browsers support a thing called WebRTC
2014-05-27 11:25:13	kennric	it's html5 and webrtc, so just a recent standards-compliant browser
2014-05-27 11:25:27	mathuin	I will have to try it.
2014-05-27 11:25:30	mythmon	which is a suite of apis that allow for real time video, audio, and data transfer between clients.
2014-05-27 11:25:44	mythmon	as well as video and audio capture and playback.
2014-05-27 11:25:54	mathuin	Who implements the API?  The browser vendor, or plugins, or what?
2014-05-27 11:26:18	Ac-town	does webrtc have encryption?
2014-05-27 11:26:36	kennric	unlike hangouts, which demanded I install a plugin that wasn't available for my os, but suggested I add its special repo to my package sources
2014-05-27 11:27:21	mythmon	mathuin: the browser vendors implement.
2014-05-27 11:27:24	mythmon	in firefox, it is open source.
2014-05-27 11:27:32	mythmon	(I don't know if it is open source or not in Chrome)
2014-05-27 11:28:16	mythmon	Ac-town: i think so, but i should find that out.
2014-05-27 11:28:32	mythmon	also, in the case where it is possible, webrtc can do direct peer to peer connections.
2014-05-27 11:29:04	mythmon	Ac-town: this is what I learned: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17537307/is-webrtc-video-encrypted-before-being-streamed
2014-05-27 11:29:19	kennric	in many ways, open standards are more important that open source
2014-05-27 11:30:05	mythmon	both are best.
2014-05-27 11:30:44	kennric	I am far more accepting of proprietary software using open standards than proprietary standards with any kind of endpoints
2014-05-27 11:31:33	kennric	proprietary standards break everything, proprietary endpoints break for the endpoint user
2014-05-27 11:31:36	bkero	Open standards without first-class open source implementations lead to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish
2014-05-27 11:32:47	kennric	yep, but if the standard is open, it at least has a chance. I agree ideally we want both, but open standards/infrastructure is a necessary first principle
2014-05-27 11:34:06	kennric	definitely agree that first class OS implementations are necessary to keep a standard useful, they just don't have to be the only implementations
2014-05-27 11:35:07	kennric	all of which might be slightly outside the scope of mathuin's original question
2014-05-27 11:35:22	kennric	but he knew the crowd he was asking it in :)

2014-05-27 14:52:52	mythmon	steams new tag system has a tag for local multiplayer that has some good things in it.
2014-05-27 14:56:01	bkero	mythmon: have you heard of Samurai Gunn?
2014-05-27 14:56:14	mythmon	bkero: just recently.
2014-05-27 14:56:24	mythmon	i haven't tried it yet.
2014-05-27 14:56:25	bkero	jnoah: I would love to get a combined emulation system set up to support 4 player games.
2014-05-27 14:56:46	bkero	Like an xbmc plugin that would let us play SNES Bomberman, Wii SSB, Xbox/PC Halo, etc.
2014-05-27 14:56:52	bkero	Using the 360 remotes on my PC
2014-05-27 14:57:09	mythmon	bkero: are you aware that there is a way to set up an xbmc plugin to launch steam in big picture mode, and then return?
2014-05-27 14:57:43	bkero	mythmon: Yeah. That would be nicely useful.
2014-05-27 14:57:52	bkero	mythmon: xbmc has no such plugin though
2014-05-27 14:57:57	mythmon	bkero: lies!
2014-05-27 14:57:59	mythmon	I have it at home.
2014-05-27 14:58:10	bkero	mythmon: As I recall it has separate plugins for each emulated system.
2014-05-27 14:58:24	mythmon	really what it is is a systemd unit for xbmc and another for steam, and then a doodad that toggles them.
2014-05-27 14:58:28	bkero	Heh
2014-05-27 14:58:31	bkero	That would work well!
2014-05-27 14:58:33	mythmon	the emulation thing is another story though, that i've never figured out.
2014-05-27 14:58:37	mythmon	it does, actually.
2014-05-27 14:58:48	mythmon	relud might know a little more about emulators and xbmc.
2014-05-27 14:59:50	terrellt	Is just a KVM for switching input?
2014-05-27 14:59:52	relud	it's been a very long time
2014-05-27 14:59:58	terrellt	s/is/is it
2014-05-27 15:00:36	bkero	terrellt: I have serial control over my home theatre receiver. I can do input switching as much as I want.
2014-05-27 15:00:47	terrellt	Neat
2014-05-27 15:00:59	relud	all i know is there was a cross-platform plugin for xbmc that dowloaded metadata, and had support for launching arbitrary emulators per system, and had a /lot/ of systems that it included.
2014-05-27 15:03:25	mythmon	terrellt: i only have one system on the tv, with different software controlling the system.
2014-05-27 15:05:14	jnoah	bkero: i think this should happen
2014-05-27 15:05:27	jnoah	aren't there online play plugins for emulators already?
2014-05-27 15:10:35	shirgan	Has anyone heard of any of the games on the most recent Humble Bundle?
2014-05-27 15:10:50	shirgan	They look sort of cool, but I don't know if I'll pick it up yet.
2014-05-27 15:11:26	mathuin	My wife liked "Draw a stickman", I don't know if she has epic or not.
2014-05-27 15:12:26	Odysimus	galcon is how i would picture astroids on acid
2014-05-27 15:13:48	Odysimus	and metal slug is an arcade classic
2014-05-27 15:22:51	phc	i've been playing battleblock theater for 360, and i'd say it's a great party game
2014-05-27 15:23:14	phc	quirky/stupid music, easy-to-learn controls, fun and colorful levels, etc....
2014-05-27 15:41:48	shirgan	Cool, I'll probably buy the bundle.
2014-05-27 15:53:44	bkero	phc: that looks like it's done by the Binding of Isaac guys

2014-05-27 16:37:30	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: mathuin: right. but then, one shouldn't be using MS Access anyways.
2014-05-27 16:37:56	mathuin	I do miss having a relational database in my office suite.
2014-05-27 16:38:10	mathuin	but to be honest, we can leverage the spreadsheet for our current needs.
2014-05-27 16:38:46	mythmon	mathuin: out of curiosity, what are you doing?
2014-05-27 16:38:49	kennric	mathuin: it's called a python terminal and sqlite :)
2014-05-27 16:39:48	mathuin	The food science club tracks attendance and funding points.  I'm designing a tool that will use a magnetic card reader so meeting attendees can just zip their card through instead of writing their name on a piece of paper which the secretary has to enter later.

2014-05-27 16:40:04	mathuin	and yeah, sqlite would be nice, but it's not "in the cloud".
2014-05-27 16:40:39	mathuin	If I had my way, I'd make a trivial Django app -- but there's no space for that for clubs.
2014-05-27 16:40:42	mythmon	mathuin: scripting against google sheets is not trivial.
2014-05-27 16:40:55	mathuin	We get crappy Drupal sites and no support.
2014-05-27 16:41:11	kennric	can you install your own drupal plugins?
2014-05-27 16:41:33	mathuin	I don't think so.

2014-05-27 16:44:14	mathuin	All I've been able to do with our Drupal site is update "stories" and post events on a calendar, and when I went to CWS asking for more support I didn't get a very inspiring response.
2014-05-27 16:44:48	mathuin	I would *love* to have the ability for normal club members to log into the club website and see their own attendance records.
2014-05-27 16:44:56	mathuin	but CWS said they don't support "social media features".
2014-05-27 16:47:02	kennric	that's a pity.
2014-05-27 16:47:32	mathuin	Yeah.  So instead we use Facebook for all that stuff.

2014-05-27 16:49:11	kennric	well, write a django app and I'll host it for you
2014-05-27 16:49:20	mathuin	I can host it.
2014-05-27 16:49:24	mathuin	I don't want to. :-)
2014-05-27 16:49:29	mathuin	I think the school should host it.
2014-05-27 16:49:41	kennric	they should
2014-05-27 16:49:42	mathuin	So I need to lobby for it. :-)
2014-05-27 16:49:59	kennric	I understand why they don't though
2014-05-27 16:50:04	mathuin	Well, sure.
2014-05-27 16:50:22	mathuin	But creating club-specific Google Apps would be trivial.
2014-05-27 16:50:44	kennric	when I worked at CWS, I got to see first hand a lot of the cleanup of old custum broken insecure forgotten little sites
2014-05-27 16:50:58	mathuin	I think they're working on consolidating the thousands of Drupal instances.
2014-05-27 16:51:02	mathuin	Still, I mean.
2014-05-27 16:51:50	kennric	yeah, google apps would work, or they should be willing to add a little more functionality to drupal
2014-05-27 16:53:00	mathuin	They already offer something like what I asked for (logging in with ONIDs) for ASOSU elections.

2014-05-27 22:15:49	bramwelt	Eh, it didn't really teach me to wireshark, more of a "Oh, that is what I'm looking at" sort of thing.

2014-05-28 09:09:03	@hamper	lrr actually meant: of all the things i dislike about optimous, it turns out that using it was miles esier for my opencl project than using a supposedly easier to use windows setup

2014-05-28 09:09:47	mythmon	edunham: i'm pretty sure i'm just going to rewrite factoids this weekend.
2014-05-28 09:09:54	edunham	:)
2014-05-28 09:09:58	edunham	factoids is the best plugin
2014-05-28 09:10:24	mythmon	to be fair, it's also kind of the worst.
2014-05-28 09:10:37	mythmon	did you see the thing uberj did?
2014-05-28 09:12:12	edunham	nope, I haven't been reading much hamper lately
2014-05-28 09:12:14	edunham	mostly monte
2014-05-28 09:22:48	mythmon	he basically leapfrogged over regexlearn and went straight to parsleylearn
2014-05-28 09:24:01	edunham	heh
2014-05-28 09:24:16	mythmon	it's interesting.
2014-05-28 09:24:33	edunham	well, parsleylearn hasn't been actively detrimental
2014-05-28 09:25:18	mythmon	hmm?
2014-05-28 09:27:00	edunham	I haven't noticed that it's there
2014-05-28 09:27:04	edunham	ie, it hasn't broken things
2014-05-28 09:27:06	edunham	thus, not too bad
2014-05-28 09:39:45	mythmon	it's not there.
2014-05-28 09:39:47	mythmon	it's a branch.
2014-05-28 09:40:19	edunham	oh xD
2014-05-28 09:40:22	edunham	that would explain it.
2014-05-28 09:43:35	edunham	mythmon: i was on a site that abused rawgithub.com for sourceing a script, and i got a popup about it saying i should complain to the owner.
2014-05-28 09:43:40	edunham	is this a feature of whimsy?
2014-05-28 09:44:28	edunham	oh hey, http://ohc.uoregon.edu/S_2014-Schneier.html is tonight
2014-05-28 09:46:10	mythmon	edunham: that doesn't sound like a whimsy feature to me.
2014-05-28 09:47:49	edunham	hmm. maybe it's a rawgit feature.
2014-05-28 09:47:55	mythmon	it would be new.
2014-05-28 09:47:59	mythmon	what's the site?
2014-05-28 09:48:33	edunham	they fixed it now
2014-05-28 09:48:45	mythmon	ah
2014-05-28 09:49:04	mythmon	i'm pretty sure github is not happy about people abusing rawgithub.
2014-05-28 09:49:16	mythmon	so maybe they have started doing that for certain content.

2014-05-28 11:53:12	terrellt	Fair point. Can't blow up flip and not inconvenience others.
2014-05-28 12:02:23	jnoah	use docker on flip?

2014-05-28 12:54:02	mythmon	relud: i have trouble with my clickpad recognizing two finger clicks sometimes. if my fingers are two far apart, it interprets it as a single finger click. do you know if that is tunable?
2014-05-28 12:54:37	relud	too far apart?
2014-05-28 12:54:40	relud	that's strange
2014-05-28 12:54:45	relud	i have no experience with that.
2014-05-28 12:55:13	mythmon	wait, what.
2014-05-28 12:55:31	mythmon	"Fingers closer together than 30% of the touchpad's size [2] will count towards ClickFinger actions, others will be skipped. So in the default use-case, where you have two fingers down on the touchpad in the middle and you use a third to click the button, you will still get a ClickFinger2 action. Likewise, if you press with two fingers down, you will also get a ClickFinger2 action."
2014-05-28 12:55:51	mythmon	that's highly unexpected.
2014-05-28 12:56:00	relud	i see why
2014-05-28 12:56:06	relud	so you can thumb click
2014-05-28 12:56:13	mythmon	"[2] All touchpads lie about their size, so we just hardcode 30% since anything we infer is going to be wrong anyways"
2014-05-28 12:56:32	relud	>_<
2014-05-28 12:56:51	mythmon	except, two fingers on the pad + a thumb to click gives me 3-finger click = middle.
2014-05-28 12:57:01	relud	mythmon: build your own syntaptics package?
2014-05-28 12:57:21	 *	mythmon sighs
2014-05-28 12:57:32	relud	modify the source to set it to 100% instead of 30%
2014-05-28 12:57:53	mythmon	it seems that two finger clicks and three finger clicks are handled differently.
2014-05-28 13:00:16	mythmon	ooh. "Synaptics driver for notebook touchpads - Forked branch with -m flag forward ported and 4/5 finger detectable"
2014-05-28 13:05:45	mathuin	You're not the only one with that itch, it seems.
2014-05-28 13:06:00	mythmon	well, it isn't actually a fix for the problem.
2014-05-28 13:06:07	mythmon	and it didn't do what I hoped it would do.
2014-05-28 13:06:22	mythmon	but then, for some reason I now have multitouch on my touchscreen, so that's neat.
2014-05-28 13:15:20	mythmon	relud: now two finger movement on my touchscreen causes firefox (and anything else) to scroll.
2014-05-28 13:26:41	relud	heh, your touchscreen is now being controlled by synaptics
2014-05-28 14:01:29	mythmon	relud: actually, no.
2014-05-28 14:01:49	mythmon	for some reason whatever i did is allowing real multitouch events to come out of my screen, so I could use touchegg to configure things.
2014-05-28 14:01:56	mythmon	maybe synaptics did that, but I don't think so.
2014-05-28 14:02:10	relud	strange
2014-05-28 14:04:09	mythmon	so now i have things like two finger scrolling, and 3 finger swipes to switch hlwm tags. though I'm not sure how useful that is.

2014-05-28 14:16:40	mythmon	that gives more details, including saying that yes, arrows are transitive.
2014-05-28 14:16:45	mythmon	a -> b -> c implies a -> c
2014-05-28 14:19:23	edunham	jnoah: hey, wanna write a blog post about the talk?

2014-05-28 16:05:33	Orcbane	Does the lug work with the OSL at all?

2014-05-28 16:44:56	bramwelt	I would appreciate a ride
2014-05-28 16:45:02	Orcbane	I've been fond of my current distro for quite awhile.  I don't really have plans for ditching it.
2014-05-28 16:45:08	edunham	actually lucy canceled so current roster is chekkaa if he wakes up in time, chaos, muricula
2014-05-28 16:45:14	edunham	and i have 1 more seatbelt
2014-05-28 16:45:25	edunham	so... how fond are you of legroom, or fast at calling shotgun? :)
2014-05-28 16:45:43	edunham	bramwelt: so you're welcome to my 4th seat, it'll just be a little squished
2014-05-28 16:45:47	edunham	also i think irdan
2014-05-28 16:45:50	edunham	's taking a car
2014-05-28 16:45:52	bramwelt	I have very little concept of personal space, as you know I am a dancer. :)
2014-05-28 16:45:57	bramwelt	irdan is full up.
2014-05-28 16:46:07	bramwelt	Just need the when and where, please.
2014-05-28 16:46:32	irdan	and pono just asked me if i had room
2014-05-28 16:46:46	bramwelt	herps
2014-05-28 16:46:52	edunham	oh okay
2014-05-28 16:46:57	edunham	actually muri might cancel on me
2014-05-28 16:46:58	irdan	one of the people i was giong to give a ride said he would be willing to drive if there was a need
2014-05-28 16:47:10	edunham	so i *nominally* have enough extra seats for pono but. uhh.
2014-05-28 16:47:21	irdan	i'll see if that's a possibility
2014-05-28 16:47:30	bramwelt	edunham: I'll poke muri

2014-05-28 16:47:57	edunham	is approximately the size of my car.
2014-05-28 16:48:11	edunham	so. uhh. y'all are welcome to clown-car in as many humans as i have seatbelts
2014-05-28 16:48:12	bramwelt	muricula is not going. Just checked :)
2014-05-28 16:48:20	edunham	but i cannot promise there will be breathing space or legroom
2014-05-28 16:48:20	bkero	http://home.centurytel.net/bbyrd2100/shgokart.jpg is approximately the size of your car
2014-05-28 16:48:45	edunham	bkero: you shush. I have successfully fit blkperl, krinkle, nibz, and Corbin in my car all at once before.
2014-05-28 16:48:55	edunham	because Reasons.
2014-05-28 16:49:01	bkero	edunham: O_o
2014-05-28 16:49:11	bkero	edunham: Where did the other four sit?
2014-05-28 16:49:23	edunham	i was driving
2014-05-28 16:49:29	edunham	the first three were back seat
2014-05-28 16:49:38	edunham	and nibz wouldn't stop singing lego movie songs... it was fun :)

2014-05-28 16:54:26	edunham	we just did load balancing on the whiteboard and it's unfun to fit 4 people in either of the small cars if it's not essential
2014-05-28 16:54:47	bramwelt	edunham: sure
2014-05-28 16:55:01	edunham	irdan and spaceships are both taking cars, and their excursion meets at 5:30pm at Kerr
2014-05-28 16:56:06	bramwelt	Sweet. I'll rendezvous there.
2014-05-28 16:56:10	rordway	if it was not for the nick highlighting in my IRC client, I would have thought you were trying to send people to space, edunham
2014-05-28 16:56:22	edunham	rordway: haha that'd be even cooler
2014-05-28 16:59:11	terrellt	And bramwelt said they'd be happy to not take the spaceship, astonishing.

2014-05-29 11:51:19	mythmon	have you written quicksort anywhere else?

2014-05-29 11:57:05	mythmon	ah.
2014-05-29 11:57:16	mythmon	also, it might be worth implementing quicksort in something you are familiar with first, and then tackle the prolog version.
2014-05-29 11:57:28	mythmon	quicksort is a tricky beast.
2014-05-29 11:57:38	chekkaa	I've decided to use pyglet since it looks like the correct level I'm looking for
2014-05-29 11:58:04	mythmon	i know little about the subject, but that sound about right.
2014-05-29 11:58:07	chekkaa	cocos2d abstracts the game loop, which I need to run for the server client, and I don't want to write it two different ways

2014-05-29 11:58:32	chekkaa	pyopengl is too low level
2014-05-29 11:58:51	mythmon	do any of them support python 3.4?
2014-05-29 11:59:02	 *	chekkaa shrugs
2014-05-29 11:59:10	mythmon	because it would be pretty neat to use the new asyncio library from 3.4.

2014-05-29 11:59:37	chekkaa	is async io not a thing in python? o_O
2014-05-29 11:59:50	chekkaa	before 3.4
2014-05-29 12:00:00	mythmon	not in the stdlib.
2014-05-29 12:00:02	mythmon	There is Twisted.

2014-05-29 12:01:41	chekkaa	pthreads + io call?
2014-05-29 12:01:51	chekkaa	or do I misunderstanf the issue?
2014-05-29 12:01:57	mythmon	chekkaa: the io call is still sync :)
2014-05-29 12:02:02	chekkaa	jnoah: what was that for
2014-05-29 12:02:10	spectralsun	carnival?
2014-05-29 12:02:11	chekkaa	mythmon: ok, then I misunderstand the issue
2014-05-29 12:02:30	mythmon	your options are Twisted, gevent, Tornado, python3.4 and asyncio, or doing really low level network code.
2014-05-29 12:02:31	chekkaa	and I don't know what async io is
2014-05-29 12:02:33	jnoah	the idea of mcgrath in the dunk tank
2014-05-29 12:02:54	mythmon	chekkaa: asyncio is a library. the general idea of asyncronous io is the ability to do things while you're waiting for io to complete.
2014-05-29 12:02:54	jnoah	i want the entire OSL to take a fieldtrip over there and dunk him individually
2014-05-29 12:02:56	jnoah	:P
2014-05-29 12:03:30	chekkaa	mythmon: I don't see why pthreads + sync io isn't a workaround
2014-05-29 12:03:31	mythmon	most IO in basic python is syncronous. For example, if you write stuff to a file, you can't do anything else until you are done writing that.
2014-05-29 12:03:34	jnoah	he's a good instructor (if you see him in his office), but he trolls all the time in class...so a little payback would be nice :D
2014-05-29 12:04:00	mythmon	chekkaa: because you have to write the data to the pthreads, and you would have to do *that* syncronously.
2014-05-29 12:04:08	mythmon	plus, don't use pthreads.
2014-05-29 12:04:18	mythmon	use the multiprocessing library that is in the stdlib.
2014-05-29 12:04:25	chekkaa	pthreads is an example of multithreading because idk what else there is
2014-05-29 12:04:30	mythmon	anyways, what you *should* do is either use Twisted, or use Python3.4 and the asyncio library.
2014-05-29 12:04:36	chekkaa	I should have just said multitthreading
2014-05-29 12:05:23	mythmon	rolling your own will be hell, and doing syncronous networking is suicide for a gameserver.
2014-05-29 12:07:01	chekkaa	mythmon: that's true, I haven't thought about that
2014-05-29 12:07:16	chekkaa	I'm only doing the client for now
2014-05-29 12:07:21	chekkaa	single player
2014-05-29 12:07:32	chekkaa	and I can just load everything at once
2014-05-29 12:07:42	chekkaa	so it's not a big issue
2014-05-29 12:08:00	chekkaa	but for networking, I will probably use twisted then
2014-05-29 12:08:17	chekkaa	thanks for the suggestion
2014-05-29 12:09:49	chekkaa	mythmon: actually wait, why wouldn't running synchronous calls in another thread work again?  I don't see why you have to transfer anything if there is shared memory

2014-05-29 13:02:38	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: also, Schneier is considered to be a expert in security and cryptography. He's also an old guy who wants to sell a book.
2014-05-29 13:03:06	pwnguin	he has a book, is it surprising he's on a book tour?

2014-05-29 13:03:52	pono	Celebrity will do that to you.

2014-05-29 13:08:28	chekkaa	woah, I created a new .pl file in vim and it was using perl syntax highlighting
2014-05-29 13:08:42	chekkaa	then I wrote some prolog and saved it and reopened it
2014-05-29 13:08:49	chekkaa	and it was prolog syntax highlighting
2014-05-29 13:08:51	chekkaa	o_O

2014-05-29 13:30:04	lrr	hmm... someone in my family today just got a dog. i cant tell (yet) if it's my parents or my brother.
2014-05-29 13:33:29	drkitty	If only vim could reliably tell the different between html and htmldjango.
2014-05-29 13:35:20	spectralsun	drkitty: you mean the templates?
2014-05-29 13:36:26	spectralsun	drkitty: you could save your templates as .htmld or something.
2014-05-29 13:36:59	drkitty	That is true.
2014-05-29 13:37:07	spectralsun	i did this with jinja - saved templates as .jinja.
2014-05-29 13:37:28	spectralsun	now, with django, i just save everything as html and turn that syntax highlighting on because im never not writing templated html.
2014-05-29 13:46:56	chance	you can also use set ft= in your file header using the vim specific header
2014-05-29 13:48:10	chance	i think you might be able to do something like <!-- vim: set filetype=jinja -->
2014-05-29 13:48:26	chance	and then add a jinja syntax theme to your vim
2014-05-29 13:48:38	spectralsun	chance: i don't think he is using jinja.
2014-05-29 13:48:55	chance	ah oh it was chekkaa
2014-05-29 13:49:00	spectralsun	but the same could apply more sanely to 'htmld'.
2014-05-29 13:49:20	drkitty	We are using jinja
2014-05-29 13:49:20	chance	% vim: setfiletype=prolog
2014-05-29 13:49:23	chance	chekkaa: ^
2014-05-29 13:49:32	spectralsun	drkitty: nice :)
2014-05-29 13:49:32	chance	also make sure you have a prolog theme
2014-05-29 13:49:33	drkitty	but vim's htmldjango highlighting works well enough.
2014-05-29 13:49:35	spectralsun	jinja++
2014-05-29 13:49:42	drkitty	jinja++ indeed

2014-05-29 19:37:47	muricula	Does anyone know how to capture the segmentation fault signal? I tried:
2014-05-29 19:38:03	muricula	signal(SIGSEGV, handler_func);
2014-05-29 19:38:03	@hamper	Take off every 'SIG'.
2014-05-29 19:38:09	muricula	but that doesn't work
2014-05-29 19:38:23	muricula	SIG
2014-05-29 19:38:23	@hamper	Take off every 'SIG'.
2014-05-29 19:38:29	muricula	hamper: why?
2014-05-29 19:38:29	@hamper	muricula: Ask again later.
2014-05-29 19:38:46	frostsnow	muricula: killall -USR1 dd
2014-05-29 19:38:54	frostsnow	Instead of -SIDUSR1
2014-05-29 19:38:56	frostsnow	Erm
2014-05-29 19:39:00	frostsnow	!s/D/G/
2014-05-29 19:39:00	@hamper	frostsnow actually meant: Instead of -SIGUSR1
2014-05-29 19:39:20	frostsnow	(but I don't know the answer to your question, sadly; been too long since I played with signals)
2014-05-29 19:41:34	muricula	Oh, it worked but caused another segfault - my case to generate the segault was infinite recursion.
2014-05-29 19:42:17	frostsnow	SIGSEGV handler causes a segfault? Ironic
2014-05-29 19:42:17	@hamper	Take off every 'SIG'.
2014-05-29 19:42:21	frostsnow	hamper: shut up
2014-05-29 19:43:39	muricula	Better question: why does this code loop infinitely?
2014-05-29 19:43:40	muricula	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7611/
2014-05-29 19:45:28	frostsnow	muricula: When the signal-handler exits, does it try re-executing the last code bit it was on?
2014-05-29 19:45:44	frostsnow	(In which case it will contintually try and de-reference a NULL pointer)
2014-05-29 19:46:26	muricula	that's what I suspect, but I'm not sure.
2014-05-29 19:46:35	muricula	That's also pretty stupid.
2014-05-29 19:46:39	frostsnow	Make i a global variable and have the signal handler malloc space for it
2014-05-29 19:46:54	frostsnow	(and re-assign the pointer)
2014-05-29 19:46:57	frostsnow	See if that fixes it
2014-05-29 19:47:05	frostsnow	Well, that is how signals behave
2014-05-29 19:47:30	frostsnow	You wouldn't want a program to skip arbitrary lines of code because it received a signal
2014-05-29 19:48:38	muricula	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7616/
2014-05-29 19:48:48	muricula	frostsnow: that doesn't work either
2014-05-29 19:49:36	frostsnow	muricula: Try declaring i as volatile
2014-05-29 19:49:45	frostsnow	muricula: 'volatile *i;'
2014-05-29 19:49:46	muricula	what does volatile mean again?
2014-05-29 19:49:59	frostsnow	It means to re-calculate the address on every de-reference
2014-05-29 19:50:24	muricula	oh. Nope, that doesn't fix it.
2014-05-29 19:50:26	frostsnow	Right now the program may have cached the NULL address and not be updating it
2014-05-29 19:50:30	frostsnow	Hmmmmm
2014-05-29 19:53:09	muricula	I'm going to ask stack overflow
2014-05-29 19:53:32	frostsnow	muricula: 'man signal'
2014-05-29 19:53:39	frostsnow	According  to  POSIX,  the  behavior of a process is undefined after it ignores a SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV signal that was not generated by kill(2) or raise(3).  Integer division by zero has undefined result.  On some architectures it will generate a SIGFPE signal.  (Also dividing the most negative integer by -1 may generate SIGFPE.)  Ignoring this  signal  might lead to an endless loop.
2014-05-29 19:53:40	@hamper	Take off every 'SIG'.
2014-05-29 19:53:46	frostsnow	Possible related?
2014-05-29 19:55:03	frostsnow	You may have better luck using older signal-handling functions

2014-05-30 11:41:11	bkero	*certain
2014-05-30 11:41:31	bkero	I think that'd be an excellent project then. Have all the luggites make some little http servers to do silly things.

2014-05-30 11:47:30	bkero	spectralsun: I read this channel, I'm aware. :)
2014-05-30 11:47:38	spectralsun	:)
2014-05-30 11:49:49	Orcbane	Out of curiousity, has anyone here made a mailserver?
2014-05-30 11:50:57	bkero	Run away very fast.
2014-05-30 11:52:24	spectralsun	Orcbane: http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/
2014-05-30 11:53:03	spectralsun	" Easy to follow howto on setting up a mail server with unlimited users and domains, with IMAP/Pop access, anti-spam, anti-virus, secure authentication, encrypted traffic, web mail interface and more. "
2014-05-30 11:53:38	Orcbane	spectralsun: I did find some postfix tutorials, I just don't have a machine available to set one up yet.  I'd rather not set up a mailserver on a laptop.
2014-05-30 11:53:59	Orcbane	I do have someone who has a desktop in Seattle who said I could use one.
2014-05-30 11:54:00	spectralsun	Orcbane: $5 at digital ocean
2014-05-30 11:55:40	Orcbane	spectralsun: That's a good site, I might have to use it for other projects.
2014-05-30 11:56:09	Orcbane	spectralsun: Currently have another machine downstairs that I think I'm going to use to learn dm_crypt.
2014-05-30 11:56:25	Orcbane	And probably also a minecraft server.

2014-05-30 11:58:47	Orcbane	Did so, think I may need an account first.  Hang on.
2014-05-30 11:58:51	spectralsun	Orcbane: if you set up a mail server, I *highly* recommend that flurdy doc. It has never failed me. I would call it robust.

2014-05-30 12:01:57	Orcbane	What distro are you running, if you don't mind my asking?
2014-05-30 12:02:07	spectralsun	arch
2014-05-30 12:02:21	Orcbane	Arch is pretty nice.  I've used it in the past.
2014-05-30 12:02:34	spectralsun	sadly, digital ocean dropped/is dropping support for arch.
2014-05-30 12:03:16	Orcbane	And I'm guessing no support for Slackware, right?
2014-05-30 12:03:21	spectralsun	Hah.
2014-05-30 12:03:26	Orcbane	Heh.
2014-05-30 12:03:45	Orcbane	Thought so.
2014-05-30 12:04:02	Orcbane	Slackware is my favorite.
2014-05-30 12:04:45	spectralsun	Orcbane: Been using linux awhile?
2014-05-30 12:05:24	Orcbane	spectralsun: I'd say about 8 years.  I started not too long after my sophomore year in high school.
2014-05-30 12:06:07	Orcbane	How about you?
2014-05-30 12:08:12	spectralsun	Orcbane: exact same pretty much, about 8-9 years. First distro I tried was slax.
2014-05-30 12:10:04	Orcbane	spectralsun: I think the first one I tried was Xandros. Came in a cd in a book.
2014-05-30 12:10:21	Orcbane	Never tried slax, honestly.
2014-05-30 12:10:45	spectralsun	it was just the first one that I heard of
2014-05-30 12:11:14	Orcbane	I think if it is anything like Slackware, it would be a tough one to start with.
2014-05-30 12:11:49	spectralsun	nah, it wasn't too bad. it is supposed to be a live CD, not really meant to install it
2014-05-30 12:12:07	spectralsun	you can configure your modules online before you download a custom .iso
2014-05-30 12:12:31	Orcbane	That's pretty cool.  The first iso I used was Knoppix.

2014-05-30 12:12:40	Orcbane	pardon me, liveCD.
2014-05-30 12:12:44	spectralsun	I used that shortly after ;)
2014-05-30 12:12:56	spectralsun	Oh wait, I am thinking of Knoppix-STD
2014-05-30 12:12:59	spectralsun	hehe
2014-05-30 12:13:14	Orcbane	I think my favorite thing about Knoppix is the Vetruvian Tux.

2014-05-30 20:06:25	frostsnow	So I'm trying to make administering/scripting my home systems easier and more maintainable, especially with regards to bash scripting, and I'm wondering if the idea I've had of putting system-specific environment variables in a file and sourcing that for my bash scripts is a good idea.
2014-05-30 20:08:05	frostsnow	Also comes the issue of saving valuable configuration files; some of them are the same across different types of systems, while others differ (ex: laptop, desktop, and servers) would all have slightly different requirements.
2014-05-30 20:10:14	edunham	or puppet or chef?
2014-05-30 20:10:52	frostsnow	I've heard of Puppet, but never tried it. Think it'd be useful for home usage?
2014-05-30 20:12:01	jnoah	that *might* be a bit excessive for home use, but useful nonetheless
2014-05-30 20:12:43	frostsnow	Hmm. I always imagined Puppet is something an adminisitrator would use to access employee's computers, but I'm really quite ignorant in that regard
2014-05-30 20:13:04	jnoah	nah
2014-05-30 20:13:09	jnoah	it's configuration management
2014-05-30 20:13:20	frostsnow	But probably just about anything would be better than what I'm thinking of (which is to just copy config files into a similar-looking directory structure :P)
2014-05-30 20:13:27	jnoah	makes deploying new machines with predetermined configs super easy
2014-05-30 20:13:43	frostsnow	Hmmm that does sound useful
2014-05-30 20:13:53	jnoah	idunno how good gentoo support is for these though
2014-05-30 20:14:00	frostsnow	Yeeeaahhh
2014-05-30 20:14:14	frostsnow	There gets a point where trying to do things with bash becomes... difficult
2014-05-30 20:14:36	frostsnow	THough having working bash system-administration scripts and saving config files are arguably two separate tasks
2014-05-30 20:14:48	jnoah	well with puppet/chef you are using ruby and ruby-ish
2014-05-30 20:15:43	frostsnow	The problem I'm having with bash is that I'm trying to separate functionality into modules put am having to pass 52138 parameters to each script rather than setting environment variables and using those. I find bash's lack of composite types ... disturbing.
2014-05-30 20:16:09	frostsnow	I've never touched ruby, nor have I heard good things about it :/
2014-05-30 20:16:33	frostsnow	But the code base shouldn't really affect the end product... right?
2014-05-30 20:16:54	frostsnow	Or is it like xmonad which has is written -and- configured in Haskell?
2014-05-30 20:17:28	frostsnow	And, no, I can't just Google that right now, because I've re-remembered that I need a switch if I want Internet to both of my computers :P
2014-05-30 20:17:53	jnoah	i don't use either. so i cannot say. both are used at the OSL so i'm sure some of the sysadmins can speak to them
2014-05-30 20:21:17	frostsnow	Hmm okay
2014-05-30 20:22:26	chance	something like ansible might be better
2014-05-30 20:22:58	frostsnow	chance: What is ansible?
2014-05-30 20:23:46	chance	configuration management. simpler than chef/puppet
2014-05-30 20:23:52	chance	not ruby
2014-05-30 20:24:31	frostsnow	Okay
2014-05-30 20:24:40	chance	uses yaml config files to determine things. uses ssh to run commands on remote hosts
2014-05-30 20:24:52	frostsnow	!wtf yaml
2014-05-30 20:25:02	chance	built with python, has some python api stuff too
2014-05-30 20:25:28	chance	yaml = yet another mark up language. its json, but more featureful/doesnt use brackets, quotation marks, ect. uses indentation
2014-05-30 20:26:28	chance	https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples
2014-05-30 20:26:53	frostsnow	Hmm okay. That sounds specialized to what I need, though I'll take a look at Puppet and Chef, too
2014-05-30 20:27:14	chance	both puppet and chef are a bit heavy weight imo. they require a server to contain all your state
2014-05-30 20:27:20	chance	and to provision your other servers
2014-05-30 20:27:23	chance	which isnt bad, just more work
2014-05-30 20:27:26	frostsnow	hamper: learn that !wtf yaml is <reply> You Are My Lover
2014-05-30 20:27:26	@hamper	OK, frostsnow
2014-05-30 20:27:38	chance	chef provides a free hosted chef-server though
2014-05-30 20:27:46	chance	with upto like 5 machines you can provision
2014-05-30 20:28:32	chance	you can host your own as well obviously
2014-05-30 20:28:34	frostsnow	Interesting. Yeah, that doesn't sound like what I need, since part of this configuration would be for a server...
2014-05-30 20:28:59	frostsnow	Yeah, but I don't exactly have an army of machines to configure :P
2014-05-30 20:29:19	frostsnow	Though I need something to keep my squad of boxes sane-to-maintain
2014-05-30 20:34:06	chance	although, both puppet and chef can run without a server i think
2014-05-30 20:34:13	chance	you just have to manually run things
2014-05-30 20:34:19	chance	on the machine you want them to run on
2014-05-30 20:34:55	frostsnow	Hmm okay. It's the sort of thing I'll have to spend a weekend playing around with it sounds like
2014-05-30 20:34:57	chance	ansible does that too, but since it uses ssh you can run it and have it update things
2014-05-30 20:35:00	chance	yeah.
2014-05-30 20:35:08	chance	definitely a weekend ordeal
2014-05-30 20:35:17	frostsnow	There
2014-05-30 20:35:27	frostsnow	'll be a lot of those until I get use to this SysAdmin stuff :P

2014-06-01 18:29:18	chance	part of my assumption is if your not using hjkl, is your probably not using a bunch of the other vim movement commands

2014-06-01 18:34:57	chance	chekkaa: what features of vim do you use? generally curious
2014-06-01 18:35:06	bryon	I use vim, but not hjkl because vim is what I learned, and I can't touchtype
2014-06-01 18:35:40	bryon	no touchtype = no reason to keep my fingers on "home row" = no real compelling reason to use hjkl
2014-06-01 18:36:09	chekkaa	chance: most commonly, ^u, ^d, A, w, b, d, c, y, Y, v, ^v, V, u, ^r...
2014-06-01 18:36:18	chekkaa	off the top of my head

2014-06-01 18:36:35	bryon	chekkaa++ for you're
2014-06-01 18:37:19	chance	fair enough.
2014-06-01 18:37:43	chekkaa	p, .
2014-06-01 18:37:53	chekkaa	o, O
2014-06-01 18:37:54	chance	most of those things exist as fairly typical editor features though
2014-06-01 18:38:09	chance	but, if you use enough of vim things, it begins to outweigh others, was just curious.
2014-06-01 18:38:20	 *	chance tried emacs today.
2014-06-01 18:38:22	chekkaa	does nano have all of those?
2014-06-01 18:38:46	mathuin	Eh, I use vi/vim/vi* for very simple text editing.  home keys, search and replace, and going to specific lines are all I need.  Anything more complex and I break out emacs.
2014-06-01 18:39:21	chance	chekkaa: it has most of those things yes
2014-06-01 18:39:35	chance	they're more ctrl + letter bindings though, cause obv no command mode
2014-06-01 18:39:40	chekkaa	chance: oh, and I also have some autocomplete and basic syntax checking plugins
2014-06-01 18:40:07	chance	also features which exist in any other good text editor. i understand using what you learned to begin with
2014-06-01 18:40:40	chance	i know importantly for most people is that this stuff works over ssh
2014-06-01 18:40:46	chance	which is why i was comparing nano/vim
2014-06-01 18:40:57	chance	could just as easily be emacs and anything else usually installed
2014-06-01 18:40:59	chekkaa	I guess I don't really understand your question as to why a vim user wouldn't use nano
2014-06-01 18:41:08	chekkaa	nano isn't any easier if you already use vim
2014-06-01 18:41:23	chekkaa	and vim probably has a higher skill cap
2014-06-01 18:41:36	chekkaa	and is more commonly used
2014-06-01 18:41:52	mathuin	You don't use emacs over ssh?
2014-06-01 18:41:54	mathuin	Why not?
2014-06-01 18:41:58	chance	to me, it seems like vim is only really useful if you use all of the typical stuff, as you've listed. the typical movement commands being part of it. mostly because any other editor has these features, but doesnt require changing modes.
2014-06-01 18:42:11	chance	mathuin: i wasnt saying that you couldnt.
2014-06-01 18:42:31	chekkaa	chance: I don't see why hjkl is the killer feature of vim
2014-06-01 18:42:35	chance	it isnt
2014-06-01 18:42:41	chance	the killer feature is command mode
2014-06-01 18:42:58	chekkaa	ok
2014-06-01 18:43:12	chance	ive been talking to a few other people today who use nano/emacs

2014-06-01 19:43:33	mythmon	i think a few of us have experience with squid, but it's generally considered an old technology.
2014-06-01 19:44:05	mythmon	or at least it has been replaced by other tools for most of it's use cases.
2014-06-01 19:44:12	Orcbane	Oh?  Is there a newer proxy server program that would be better to set up?  Squid's honestly the only one I know of.
2014-06-01 19:44:56	mythmon	personally i use nginx for a reverse proxy. There is also Varnish which focuses heavily on caching, and haproxy.
2014-06-01 19:45:06	muricula	mythmon: no, but there's also the force of habit to reckon with. I'm in a transition phase.
2014-06-01 19:45:35	mythmon	muricula: i think the argument is no matter where you put your fingers, most of the time you are typing letters, so hjkl is closer than the arrows.
2014-06-01 19:45:47	Orcbane	mythmon: I'll write those down.  Thanks!
2014-06-01 19:45:56	mythmon	i don't really homerow very well, but hjkl is still useful.
2014-06-01 19:46:18	mythmon	Orcbane: nginx is a general purpose web server, similar to apache, it just happens to be good at proxying.
2014-06-01 19:46:48	Orcbane	So varnish and haproxy are probably more so what I am looking for then?
2014-06-01 19:46:58	mythmon	like i said, i use nginx.
2014-06-01 19:47:11	muricula	does anyone know how to turn a php string into a mysql DATETIME?
2014-06-01 19:47:17	mythmon	i used to use haproxy, but i found nginx quicker to configure.
2014-06-01 19:47:48	mythmon	muricula: parse it, get the year/month/day, etc, call mysql DATETIME($YEAR, $MONTH, ...) ?
2014-06-01 19:47:48	Orcbane	I'll keep that in mind.  Thanks!
2014-06-01 19:47:59	Orcbane	It's an upcoming project for me.
2014-06-01 19:48:14	mythmon	Orcbane: what's the project?
2014-06-01 19:50:02	Orcbane	Oh, it's a just-for-kicks project.  I've decided that I'm going to set up a proxy server.
2014-06-01 19:50:12	Orcbane	Or reverse proxy might be a more accurate term.
2014-06-01 19:50:41	Orcbane	I've never done it before, so I was thinking it might be a bit of fun.
2014-06-01 19:52:13	mythmon	well, reverse proxies aren't really useful unless you have things for them to reverse proxy.
2014-06-01 19:55:04	Orcbane	My bad, the terminology for proxies is new to me.  Actually looking for forward-proxy things.
2014-06-01 20:02:29	Orcbane	Alright, found some of what I was looking for.
2014-06-01 20:04:59	Orcbane	Yeah, that project will probably be after my mailserver project.  The mail server will probably be more useful.
2014-06-01 20:05:38	mythmon	ah. forward proxies are quite different, and none of what i talked about is helpful for them.
2014-06-01 20:05:39	mythmon	i think.
2014-06-01 20:08:22	Orcbane	Helpful enough, nginx can also be used for them.  Although quite a few sites I looked at seemed to mention that squid is better for forward proxies.
2014-06-01 20:08:49	Orcbane	Then again, I just skimmed them.  These are Summer projects, after all.
2014-06-01 20:09:47	Orcbane	The first server I'm really going to be able to start up is my minecraft server, and I won't really be needing a reverse proxy for it.

2014-06-01 21:14:23	Orcbane	jnoah: Agreed.  Excellent show.
2014-06-01 21:15:13	mythmon	hmm
2014-06-01 21:15:15	Orcbane	jnoah: Season 4 somewhere?
2014-06-01 21:15:17	mythmon	i should go download that.
2014-06-01 21:15:54	Orcbane	The books are pretty good as well.
2014-06-01 21:15:58	Orcbane	Long, though.
2014-06-01 21:18:43	edunham	ssssssh don't spoiler anything :)
2014-06-01 21:18:53	 *	edunham will have to catch up on the current season sometime over the summer
2014-06-01 21:19:56	mythmon	a decade ago, game of thrones would be what everyone was talking about on monday.
2014-06-01 21:20:31	mythmon	now whenever we speak of game of thrones, it is in riddles and vagueness to avoid spoilers.
2014-06-01 21:21:58	Orcbane	I haven't seen any season 4 either.  But from what I've wiki'd, looks like they haven't gotten past where I am in the books yet.
2014-06-01 21:24:36	mythmon	book 4 and 5 do that thing where they split the characters.
2014-06-01 21:24:42	mythmon	as i understand it, the show is not doing that.
2014-06-01 21:24:48	mythmon	also, season 3 ended before book 3 did.
2014-06-01 21:24:58	mythmon	so the timelines, as i understand, have diverged significantly.
2014-06-01 21:26:21	Orcbane	There are quite a few significant differences that I have noticed so far.  Last book I read was the third one.
2014-06-01 21:26:43	Orcbane	Now I've moved on to Hyperion.
2014-06-01 21:30:43	spectralsun	are there as many scenes with boobs in the books as on tv?
2014-06-01 21:31:38	Orcbane	The show seems to emphasize boobs, quite honestly.
2014-06-01 21:32:00	Orcbane	Don't get me wrong, there's definitely hanky panky in the books, some of it more graphic than other parts.
2014-06-01 21:32:34	Orcbane	But the show tends to HBO it at least a fair amount,
2014-06-01 21:42:39	edunham	haha yeah, one friend vulgarly but accurately described it as "tits and treachery"... every scene has one or the other

2014-06-01 22:00:38	edunham	then like... psycho = psychological error; klepto = kleptomaniacal error
2014-06-01 22:00:40	edunham	hey, this kinda works

2014-06-02 20:26:01	chekkaa	it's interesting how it worked compared to cpython though
2014-06-02 20:26:18	chekkaa	it started more slowly, but the fps gradually rose and eventually got higher
2014-06-02 20:58:49	chance	thats how jits work
2014-06-02 20:58:54	chance	generally

2014-06-02 21:28:27	chekkaa	I should note that the 1.4 FPS improvement was from 3.2 to 4.6

2014-06-02 21:31:13	chekkaa	the draw loop is abstracted so I just used the built-in fps counter

2014-06-03 09:02:31	lrr	jordane: i got an email yesterday from my vps detailing the router issues they've been having. they're going to replace thier core router and also bring in a backup one, especially since the DC that my vps is hosted at also hosts their billing platform is at the same DC.
2014-06-03 09:02:46	lrr	mythmon: that what i was assuming, but i had no context

2014-06-03 09:03:19	lrr	mythmon: i'm thinking of (once i finally migrate to arch + cinnamon from ubuntu) that I'll do plymouth, but at the same time my boot speeds are insanely fast.

2014-06-03 09:03:38	mythmon	it didn't make anything faster, just made it prettier
2014-06-03 09:04:03	mythmon	and i spend some time at the boot process because of FDE.
2014-06-03 09:04:05	lrr	mythmon: yeah it is easy from what I've seen, but the time i'm looking at a screen is small compared to the scren glitch i see when loading the i915 driver
2014-06-03 09:05:13	lrr	mythmon: my largest time spent in bootup is loading the i915 driver and switching to framebuffer mode (which plymouth will not help iirc)

2014-06-03 13:59:54	irdan	people almost always ask way too much for used bikes, so pointing to that site brings people back to reality
2014-06-03 14:00:32	jnoah	irdan++ awesome idea
2014-06-03 14:07:54	mathuin	Something's effed with my front wheel or tube and it keeps on flattening my tires.
2014-06-03 14:08:32	mathuin	It would be worth $30 plus parts to me to throw it at someone and get back a wheel that works properly.
2014-06-03 14:13:36	spectralsun	(working wheels)++
2014-06-03 14:16:58	mathuin	No kidding!  Biking two miles home from the bar on a going-flat tube may have contributed to my wheel's defective nature.
2014-06-03 14:17:24	mathuin	But still.  A different bike store than the one across from the Oregon Trail would be a nice thing to know.  Suggestions?

2014-06-03 14:45:45	irdan	cyclotopia has great used bikes.  they cost more than a craigslist used bike - but you wil know for sure that you won't need to pour money into fixing anything any time soon
2014-06-03 14:46:17	lrr	the thing that got me the most: kona + disk breaks
2014-06-03 14:46:48	lrr	it's a bit more than the max i was wanting to spend but kona's i know are good quality
2014-06-03 14:47:26	irdan	disc brakes that are hydraulic are nontrivial to work on - but they rarely need to work.  aside from sealed braking systems (i.e. drum) they are the lowest maintenance
2014-06-03 14:48:04	lrr	would you call that a good price for a used bike of its type?
2014-06-03 14:48:17	irdan	depends on the year and the components

2014-06-03 22:35:13	pop_n_fresh	So I've got Arch running off of a RasPi and I only have 2gb partitioned for it but the SD card is 16gb. Anybody know how I would go about mounting the extra partition space to some directory so I had space to like... install packages... and git repos...
2014-06-03 22:37:11	frostsnow	pop_n_fresh: You can resize the partition and expand the filesystem
2014-06-03 22:37:26	frostsnow	pop_n_fresh: Do you know what the filesystem is?
2014-06-03 22:37:46	pop_n_fresh	Vaguely. I think I know how to resize the partition, I'm not sure how to expand the filesystem.
2014-06-03 22:38:00	frostsnow	pop_n_fresh: 'mount' will list mounted filesystems
2014-06-03 22:38:21	frostsnow	pop_n_fresh: If you're running ext[234], 'e2fsprogs' is the package the contains tools for modifying the filesystem
2014-06-03 22:38:37	frostsnow	pop_n_fresh: I believe 'resize2fs' is the tool to use, though I've never done it myself
2014-06-03 22:39:01	pop_n_fresh	I'll give it a shot.
2014-06-03 22:39:13	pop_n_fresh	It's not like I'll lose anything important.

2014-06-03 23:03:53	mythmon	you can't really do this while the system is running.
2014-06-03 23:04:24	mythmon	you could however use fdisk to create a new partition in the remaing 14GB of space that you haven't used, and mount that somewhere.
2014-06-03 23:04:40	mythmon	if you have another computer with an SD slot, resizing the partition would be better though.
2014-06-04 00:39:49	localhost00	mythmon: resize2fs will grow a mounted partition.
2014-06-04 00:40:08	mythmon	localhost00: but can you repartition on the fly?
2014-06-04 00:40:15	localhost00	Hmmm
2014-06-04 00:40:30	localhost00	Touché
2014-06-04 00:41:17	localhost00	Well, I suppose you could just repartition to allow for a larger root partition, reboot, and then resize
2014-06-04 00:41:50	localhost00	Just make sure you pay close attention to the starting sector of /
2014-06-04 00:44:20	mythmon	yeah. a lot easier to just use ext4 on a desktop.

2014-06-04 13:09:40	spectralsun	ah, bummer.
2014-06-04 13:10:15	jordane	muricula: and what is your full $PATH?
2014-06-04 13:16:23	muricula	jordane: so I figured that out, but now I'm having issues with installing packages which need python headers
2014-06-04 13:16:33	muricula	like anything which requires lxml
2014-06-04 13:17:06	jordane	heh, yeah, that is a problem..
2014-06-04 13:17:44	jordane	muricula: you need to build the libxml headers separately.
2014-06-04 13:18:10	muricula	how should I go about doing that?
2014-06-04 13:19:18	jordane	muricula: make a dir in your homedir, and install everything there. when using ./configure, use --prefix=$HOME/somedir
2014-06-04 13:19:32	jordane	then pip install --root $HOME/somedir
2014-06-04 13:20:50	jordane	muricula: this is a good explanation: http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/28966/python-gdal-package-missing-header-file-when-installing-via-pip
2014-06-04 13:21:17	jordane	using setup.py + include-dirs is probably the easiest way.
2014-06-04 13:21:27	jordane	so then just build lxml and put the headers somewhere
2014-06-04 13:22:23	deanj	muricula: We also have easy_install, which you could use to download and install packages with the --prefix option to say where to install packages to.
2014-06-04 13:23:12	muricula	jordane: I think the issue is I don't have Python.h and associated headers
2014-06-04 13:23:27	jordane	muricula: oh, you don't have those headers either? that sucks.
2014-06-04 13:23:35	muricula	Like I need to install python-devel, but I can't because I don't have yum access
2014-06-04 13:24:07	jordane	muricula: well, you can download python-devel, and unpack the headers somewhere in your homedir
2014-06-04 13:25:24	deanj	hamper: rewrite form or find more bugs?

2014-06-04 13:39:46	jordane	muricula: yep. they're probably relative
2014-06-04 13:41:33	muricula	but where are the header files like python.h which I wanted in the first place?

2014-06-04 18:29:01	edunham	the one I'm probably going to end up buying is ~$400...
2014-06-04 18:29:40	edunham	dunno how expensive you'd consider that -- it's cheaper than any road bike, and commuter bikes seem to range from ~200 for shitty ladies' models to ~700 for nice ones
2014-06-04 18:30:02	edunham	except they're like 500 - 800 if you go to corvallis cyclery

2014-06-04 18:33:08	edunham	well call it 12 perhaps?
2014-06-04 18:33:17	edunham	2hrs should be more than enough bike time...
2014-06-04 18:33:24	 *	edunham seriously considering skipping 10am-class
2014-06-04 18:33:25	jnoah	yeah, that's true
2014-06-04 18:34:02	edunham	or everyone could chowda at 11 and i could report back whether there are nice bikes :P
2014-06-04 18:34:36	jnoah	i may just go at 9. i don't have classes :)
2014-06-04 18:34:51	edunham	lucky
2014-06-04 18:35:15	jnoah	we could bump chovda if you prefer. iirc everyone was good for noon as well
2014-06-04 18:35:29	edunham	I probably won't be able to make it either way
2014-06-04 18:35:35	edunham	except if I get a bike, I could commute quickly...
2014-06-04 18:35:36	edunham	hmm.
2014-06-04 18:36:24	frostsnow	edunham: Make sure to get a -solid- U-Lock. Megan's bike got stolen a few days after she got it. Factor it into your budget
2014-06-04 18:36:44	jnoah	Oo
2014-06-04 18:36:45	jnoah	dang
2014-06-04 18:36:48	edunham	frostsnow: damn... thank you for the reminder
2014-06-04 18:37:18	chekkaa	personally I vote U lock + something for the wheels as well
2014-06-04 18:37:31	jnoah	or 2 ulocks
2014-06-04 18:37:44	jnoah	but that seems a bit much...
2014-06-04 18:37:49	edunham	I mean if I buy new, it'll be like ~$400 nice bike, ~50 fenders and rack, ~50 lock and cable and maybe a couple extra lights depending on how much locks cost
2014-06-04 18:37:52	frostsnow	It was fucking stupid if you ask me, since it was parked outside the Valley Library which has cameras *surrounding* it, except none for security around all of the student bikes.
2014-06-04 18:37:58	edunham	(like derpy little spoke lights)
2014-06-04 18:38:02	edunham	lolwut
2014-06-04 18:38:06	edunham	gg big brother, gg
2014-06-04 18:38:07	frostsnow	jnoah: They're alos heavy
2014-06-04 18:38:35	frostsnow	chekkaa: Perhaps, but that gets old fast. Maybe if you intend to leave it overnight and don't want drunken fools offing with the wheel
2014-06-04 18:38:51	edunham	also it seems very worth it to get the kind of u-lock with a mount that you attach to the bike frame when you're actually riding
2014-06-04 18:38:59	chekkaa	I really wish the cops here did more sting operations or something
2014-06-04 18:39:02	edunham	err. words are hard. but yeah.
2014-06-04 18:39:04	jnoah	edunham: yes!
2014-06-04 18:39:08	chekkaa	just attaching GPSes to various bikes
2014-06-04 18:39:17	jnoah	i don't have the mount for chekkaa's...it's annoying
2014-06-04 18:39:21	edunham	chekkaa: or leaving unlocked bikes with trackers even
2014-06-04 18:39:26	chekkaa	jnoah: I have the mount\
2014-06-04 18:39:28	chekkaa	lol
2014-06-04 18:39:29	edunham	jnoah: you could probably improvise a mount
2014-06-04 18:39:51	jnoah	or i could get my own lock when i get a new bike and give chekkaa his back...
2014-06-04 18:39:58	edunham	that'd be a good idea :P
2014-06-04 18:40:39	chekkaa	I vote super strong electromagnets
2014-06-04 18:40:41	edunham	jnoah: also TIL about bike sizing. someone my height needs a medium or ~17" frame
2014-06-04 18:40:49	chekkaa	they just stick to bike poles
2014-06-04 18:40:51	chekkaa	easy peasy
2014-06-04 18:40:59	edunham	and it's actually based on length between seat and handlebars, as well as between seat and pedals
2014-06-04 18:41:03	jnoah	edunham: where'd you read this? (I should look this up for me)
2014-06-04 18:41:10	edunham	no I talked to salespeople
2014-06-04 18:41:19	edunham	and asked a bunch of questions and used social skills :P
2014-06-04 18:41:19	jnoah	oic
2014-06-04 18:41:21	edunham	ya
2014-06-04 18:41:31	edunham	I spent like 2 hours just talking to people about bikes and bike features
2014-06-04 18:41:57	edunham	but yeah I test rode one that was too large for me, 'cause it looked really pretty and was on sale, and it just kinda feels wrong
2014-06-04 18:42:04	edunham	like it made my back and shoulders hurt
2014-06-04 18:42:13	edunham	so yeah worry about size
2014-06-04 18:43:34	edunham	also if you get a bike at the used bike sale, be aware that peak charges nearly twice as much to obtain + install fenders or rack than bike 'n' hike
2014-06-04 18:49:38	frostsnow	Also the Corvallis Bicycle Co-op is a good way to get hand-on experience repairing your own bike
2014-06-04 18:50:08	edunham	yeah, I'm going to be taking advantage of that and the on-campus bike shop place
2014-06-04 18:50:30	frostsnow	Oh yeah. I wasn's a student so I didn't do that
2014-06-04 18:50:33	jnoah	so, get bike at peak, mod at bike'n'hike?
2014-06-04 18:50:46	edunham	uhh maybe
2014-06-04 18:50:52	edunham	probably get bike at peak sale thing
2014-06-04 18:50:56	edunham	depending on what's available
2014-06-04 18:51:00	jnoah	yeah
2014-06-04 18:51:35	edunham	bike'n'hike is *probably* best place to mod -- I haven't checked out cyclotopia or properly specced out accessory prices at corvallis cyclery or that northwest multisports place yet
2014-06-04 18:51:50	edunham	it's just the cheapest out of the ones where i looked at bikes without fenders/racks and asked about pricing
2014-06-04 18:52:04	jnoah	ah
2014-06-04 18:52:34	edunham	I feel like the lights were more expensive at bike'n'hike than I've seen them elsewhere, but I do'nt remember which elsewhere that was
2014-06-04 18:57:14	jnoah	spectralsun: where did you get your spoke lights? About how much were they?
2014-06-04 18:58:40	edunham	jnoah: spoke lights will be $8-$10 at bike'n'hike and ~$6 on Amazon
2014-06-04 18:59:01	 *	edunham super tempted by http://www.amazon.com/Docooler-Programmable-Colorful-Bicycle-32-pattern/dp/B00FOIZFNK/
2014-06-04 18:59:17	jnoah	i could see those getting stolen...
2014-06-04 19:00:11	edunham	yeah... I'd super glue it to the spoke :)
2014-06-04 19:00:20	edunham	but then again it's like $12
2014-06-04 19:00:34	frostsnow	Also, when I was a Sophomore in College, they had a bike maintenance class at OSU. On top of the class, they gave you "Zinn and the Art of (Mountain|Rode) Bike Maintenance" after completing the course. Worth looking into to see if they still do that.
2014-06-04 19:00:46	edunham	frostsnow: zinn? or zen?
2014-06-04 19:00:53	frostsnow	Zinn
2014-06-04 19:00:55	frostsnow	It's a pun
2014-06-04 19:01:00	edunham	also does that Zen and the Art have a crazy alter ego in it?
2014-06-04 19:01:12	edunham	err. I should refrain from spoiling that book.
2014-06-04 19:01:15	frostsnow	Sadly, I've only gotten about 20 pages into it.
2014-06-04 19:01:16	bryon	i think i have that zinn book in storage somewhere
2014-06-04 19:01:27	edunham	frostsnow: if I give a book to Mara, will it make its way to you?
2014-06-04 19:01:35	frostsnow	edunham: Yes
2014-06-04 19:01:48	edunham	excellent.
2014-06-04 19:01:49	@hamper	edunham: stupendous!
2014-06-04 19:01:54	frostsnow	hamper: lol
2014-06-04 19:02:02	frostsnow	Is this Zinn or GEB?
2014-06-04 19:02:05	frostsnow	Erm
2014-06-04 19:02:07	frostsnow	Zen*
2014-06-04 19:02:44	edunham	frostsnow: Zen and the Art, this time around
2014-06-04 19:02:55	frostsnow	Okay
2014-06-04 19:02:56	edunham	I've resolved to stop handing out my copies of GEB before finding additional ones
2014-06-04 19:03:04	edunham	although I should give my GEB to Mara to read then hand off to you
2014-06-04 19:03:07	frostsnow	lol
2014-06-04 19:03:09	edunham	spectralsun: you still have one of my GEBs, right?
2014-06-04 19:03:37	frostsnow	So much good stuff to read
2014-06-04 19:04:00	jnoah	edunham: how many GEB do you have? How many do you really need? O_O
2014-06-04 19:04:03	edunham	jnoah: actually http://www.amazon.com/Colorful-Bicycle-Cycling-32-pattern-Waterproof/dp/B00DVEEYNG/ appears to be the same thing as above but only $9
2014-06-04 19:04:32	edunham	jnoah: I own either two or three copies. Considering that I have on average less than one in my posession at any given time, I think I need more than this.
2014-06-04 19:04:55	jnoah	heh
2014-06-04 19:05:50	edunham	yeah what the hell, I'll arrange for my copy to end up in Mara's posession before leaving for portland
2014-06-04 19:05:55	edunham	MaraJade: would you like to read GEB?
2014-06-04 19:07:11	MaraJade	edunham: What's that?
2014-06-04 19:07:18	bryon	OH MY GOD

2014-06-04 19:09:43	MaraJade	Well, if it's the former, then I'd like to read it, if the latter, no
2014-06-04 19:09:59	edunham	bryon: yes, Godel Escher Bach.

2014-06-04 20:23:04	Odysimus	anyone have any recomendations on light and cheap laptops. Would like something <$400 and <4lbs. was  looking at the lenovo s210 but people say the battery life is bad
2014-06-04 20:25:32	edunham	hmm, do you care new vs used?
2014-06-04 20:32:11	jnoah	Odysimus: the laptop i have is fantastic besides the loud fan. Brand new it was $375
2014-06-04 20:32:41	jnoah	hp something-or-other g6
2014-06-04 20:33:34	edunham	jnoah: isn't it a pretty big screen though? like 15", 17" or something?
2014-06-04 20:33:47	jnoah	15.4"
2014-06-04 20:34:14	jnoah	smallest i've ever owned :P (remeber my previous laptop? 18.1")
2014-06-04 20:35:05	edunham	haha smallest I've owned was 11"
2014-06-04 20:35:17	edunham	thinkpad x100e/x120e
2014-06-04 20:35:35	edunham	they're decent, super cheap (~200-300 used), but get pretty toasty if you try to minecraft
2014-06-04 20:37:01	mythmon	Odysimus: I had a eeepc a while ago. Cost me about $300, had a 10" screen, and was as quick as you can ask out of a dualcore atom.
2014-06-04 20:38:31	jnoah	I think i went 16.x" to 18.1" and now down to 15.4"
2014-06-04 20:38:35	jnoah	OH
2014-06-04 20:38:44	jnoah	wait, I had a 10" eeePC

2014-06-04 20:41:31	edunham	Odysimus: uhh if you want to indefinitely-borrow my thinkpad x120e you can have it on the condition that you put a disk in it
2014-06-04 20:41:42	edunham	though its battery is getting kinda old
2014-06-04 20:42:04	edunham	and I think it might be being a brat about booting right now... though I'm pretty sure I just screwed up the current disk's mbr
2014-06-04 20:43:53	jnoah	seems like that laptop is a handful...
2014-06-04 20:44:48	mythmon	i've got my old eeepc lying around. it works just fine, though it's something like 4 years old now.

2014-06-04 21:32:42	edunham	I merely dropped it in channel because I thought it'd be of interest to others as well

2014-06-05 12:27:05	jordane	chance: what do you mean prevent it from reading an env?
2014-06-05 12:27:50	chance	if i have $FOO
2014-06-05 12:28:04	chance	but i dont want $FOO to be replaced by my shell

2014-06-05 15:46:32	spectralsun	it shouldn't
2014-06-05 15:46:34	muricula	hmmm
2014-06-05 15:46:40	spectralsun	your browser may cache things
2014-06-05 15:46:59	spectralsun	but unless you code in caching or use a PHP framework that does caching, no
2014-06-05 15:47:20	spectralsun	this is not true for python... python creates the .pyc files which are like a cache and can cause issues if stale.
2014-06-05 15:47:55	muricula	I think I found it
2014-06-05 15:48:09	spectralsun	i have had weird stuff happen in python that only got resolved when i cleared out .pyc files

2014-06-05 20:51:22	akeym	as for the file, if you run the command that way, you'd need a separate line to scp the file back, or if you just want the output of the script, it comes to stdout on your local console

2014-06-05 20:57:07	illuminatedgeek	the ssh password?
2014-06-05 20:57:16	akeym	in that case it would be better to use a key
2014-06-05 20:57:18	illuminatedgeek	use a key m9
2014-06-05 20:57:22	illuminatedgeek	aw beat me to it
2014-06-05 20:57:28	muricula	or the key
2014-06-05 20:57:48	irdan	muricula: ssh-add
2014-06-05 20:57:48	akeym	you'll need to pre-copy the key to the remote host

2014-06-05 20:58:29	muricula	won't the key also have a passphrase though?

2014-06-05 21:00:36	muricula	Okay, how do I add a key to my account on the other machine so I can ssh there?
2014-06-05 21:00:52	illuminatedgeek	ssh-copy-id
2014-06-05 21:09:56	localhost00	(ssh keys)++

2014-06-05 21:14:48	muricula	mythmon: hamper's not in here, FYI
2014-06-05 21:15:17	akeym	are you running the cron job as the same user whose key you copied?
2014-06-05 21:15:42	muricula	so I don't think that user already has keys
2014-06-05 21:16:17	muricula	I generated some, but I don't know how to add it to my account
2014-06-05 21:17:46	akeym	the keys should be in the .ssh folder in the homedir of that user, i think you can also specify the key file with a commandline arg to ssh
2014-06-05 21:18:46	akeym	i suggest looking at -i
2014-06-05 21:21:28	muricula	akeym: By default there are no keys there
2014-06-05 21:27:00	muricula	I got it

2014-06-05 22:03:49	chance	also, if you hate writing shell scripts like i do, look at python fabric
2014-06-05 22:04:22	muricula	yeah well I'm also writing php, so shell scripts are no big deal

2014-06-05 22:43:06	chance	deanj: how to use hamper remindme?
2014-06-05 22:43:14	chance	your package has a - in it
2014-06-05 22:44:15	chance	also your using distutils
2014-06-05 22:44:50	chance	mythmon: you have hamper with remindme right? how do you load it?
2014-06-05 22:45:40	chance	jnoah: you might know too
2014-06-05 22:47:50	chance	so apparently you cant import modules with hyphens in it without using __import__
2014-06-05 22:55:57	chance	urg still cant load the plugin
2014-06-05 22:59:04	chance	i dont understand >.<
2014-06-05 23:03:07	chance	oh yeah i think you load those differently
2014-06-05 23:06:27	mythmon	chance: in your config, as a plugin do hamper-remindme/remindme
2014-06-05 23:06:35	chance	yeah
2014-06-05 23:06:39	chance	i figured it out
2014-06-05 23:06:50	chance	but instead i forked it cause hypens dont belong in package names
2014-06-05 23:07:38	chance	yours is dead btw mythmon
2014-06-05 23:07:41	mythmon	oh
2014-06-05 23:07:43	chance	or netsplit or something
2014-06-05 23:07:46	mythmon	chance: yeah, working on it.
2014-06-05 23:07:48	chance	muricula: you netsplit still/gone?
2014-06-05 23:07:56	mythmon	also, i realized, i don't think it is hamper-remindme, it is hamper_remindme?
2014-06-05 23:07:59	mythmon	or something.
2014-06-05 23:08:01	muricula	chance: I'm around
2014-06-05 23:08:06	chance	mythmon: no it is that
2014-06-05 23:08:10	chance	i renamed it in mine
2014-06-05 23:08:17	chance	i opened a PR to rename to hamper_remindme
2014-06-05 23:08:17	mythmon	odd...
2014-06-05 23:08:47	mythmon	yeah, that's definitely the right thing, nice going.
2014-06-05 23:08:48	chance	muricula: i thought you might find it interesting that you can use python instead of php on your flip account
2014-06-05 23:08:57	chance	i know you've written your site in php already
2014-06-05 23:09:01	chance	just something i think you'd appreciate
2014-06-05 23:09:14	mythmon	chance: how do you get apache to run the python?
2014-06-05 23:09:25	chance	http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zibolskc/cgi-bin/flask_example.py and
2014-06-05 23:09:27	mythmon	mod_wsgi? mod_python? fcgi? cgi?
2014-06-05 23:09:28	muricula	I'm writing it on onid, and exactlty what mythmon said
2014-06-05 23:09:42	chance	one sec
2014-06-05 23:09:47	mythmon	ugh. cgi.
2014-06-05 23:09:51	chance	apparently im getting an address in use error now
2014-06-05 23:09:53	mythmon	though, it is nice to know that flask can do cgi.
2014-06-05 23:10:14	mythmon	chance: don't run the script
2014-06-05 23:10:16	chance	in the mean time
2014-06-05 23:10:16	chance	http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/zibolskc/foo.py
2014-06-05 23:10:20	mythmon	apache will run that script once for every request.
2014-06-05 23:10:26	chance	oh
2014-06-05 23:10:30	chance	well it should still work.
2014-06-05 23:10:52	mythmon	it does
2014-06-05 23:10:55	chance	oops
2014-06-05 23:10:57	chance	the __main__
2014-06-05 23:10:59	mythmon	yeah

2014-06-05 23:12:37	chance	it *was* working
2014-06-05 23:12:51	chance	basically you put a python file into public_html/cgi-bin
2014-06-05 23:12:52	mythmon	cgi is no fun, trust me.
2014-06-05 23:13:07	chance	then visit /cgi-bin/cgiwrap/usernamehere/script.py
2014-06-05 23:13:17	chance	with permissions set to read + execute
2014-06-05 23:13:24	mythmon	that python script has to do the right things with envvars, stdin, and stdout.
2014-06-05 23:13:32	chance	you can use cgi with wsgi
2014-06-05 23:14:25	mythmon	that sentence doesn't really make sense.
2014-06-05 23:14:39	mythmon	wsgi and cgi are very different things.
2014-06-05 23:14:57	chance	you use a cgi handler to pass it to your app, and the handler makes it into a wsgi style data structure
2014-06-05 23:15:16	chance	eh i think i broke it
2014-06-05 23:15:24	chance	probably cause the app.run() in the firs tone
2014-06-05 23:16:13	chance	anyway
2014-06-05 23:16:15	chance	its possible
2014-06-05 23:16:17	chance	not as nice
2014-06-05 23:16:19	chance	or easy
2014-06-05 23:16:21	chance	but still possible

2014-06-05 23:16:39	chance	funny
2014-06-05 23:17:09	chance	apparently this is an open bug in in flask
2014-06-05 23:18:04	chance	ah i figured it out
2014-06-05 23:18:06	chance	trailing slash needed
2014-06-05 23:18:16	chance	http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/zibolskc/flask_example.py/
2014-06-05 23:18:21	chance	there
2014-06-05 23:18:53	muricula	yep that's a bug

2014-06-05 23:19:34	muricula	http://people.oregonstate.edu/~kronquii/
2014-06-05 23:19:49	chance	yeah, lucyw showed it to me
2014-06-05 23:20:00	chance	also, if you need hosting for website/app stuff let me know.
2014-06-05 23:20:15	muricula	^^ Warning, it's unstable and pretty shitty all around
2014-06-05 23:20:21	chance	easier to just have stuff setup on a real server than flip
2014-06-05 23:21:11	mythmon	muricula: permission to try to hack the shit out of your app?
2014-06-05 23:21:31	mythmon	or should i avoid that until it is graded?
2014-06-05 23:22:02	muricula	mythmon: please use it and report bugs, but I am certain that you can find SQL injection attacks somewhere
2014-06-05 23:22:28	muricula	After next week you can hack it all you want
2014-06-05 23:22:36	mythmon	muricula: ok.
2014-06-05 23:22:43	mythmon	i probably won't tonight, because sleep is calling.

2014-06-06 15:55:45	fridgei	the realy funny shit was yesterday she went to the store and bought a live fish
2014-06-06 15:55:48	fridgei	so she could go put it in a lake
2014-06-06 15:55:59	fridgei	its some kind of a tradition
2014-06-06 15:56:10	fridgei	and i asked if what she had for lunch
2014-06-06 15:56:12	fridgei	a different fish
2014-06-06 15:56:18	fridgei	so you go buy a fish

2014-06-07 14:23:37	chekkaa	boo, the shapely python library requires c libraries to be installed
2014-06-07 14:23:48	chekkaa	idk if that can be done through pip
2014-06-07 14:23:55	jnoah	yes it can
2014-06-07 14:23:59	chekkaa	can it?
2014-06-07 14:24:09	chekkaa	please halp
2014-06-07 14:24:14	jnoah	pip basically calls "python setup.py install"
2014-06-07 14:24:29	jnoah	which should compile the c stuff
2014-06-07 14:25:10	chekkaa	it compiles fine
2014-06-07 14:25:24	chekkaa	but when it runs, it fails because it can't find libgeos_c
2014-06-07 14:26:01	jnoah	you may need to install that separately from your package manager
2014-06-07 14:28:30	chekkaa	I am wondering if I can put it in the repo and pass pip install a --global-option for its location
2014-06-07 14:28:41	jnoah	no
2014-06-07 14:29:14	jnoah	the module you are trying to use should have some build instructions
2014-06-07 14:29:33	jnoah	which you would then include in your instructions
2014-06-07 14:31:38	chekkaa	the build instructions are simply "apt-get install libgeos-dev; pip install shapely"
2014-06-07 14:31:53	chekkaa	I don't like that though :/
2014-06-07 14:32:11	chekkaa	kinda defeats the purpose of virtualenv
2014-06-07 14:33:27	jnoah	well, you need libgeos-dev to build the package
2014-06-07 14:33:50	jnoah	so, in your setup/install instructions you would add libgeos-dev as a requirement
2014-06-07 14:33:52	jnoah	that's all
2014-06-07 14:36:01	chekkaa	but that defeats the purpose of virtualenv if it requires stuff to be installed systemwide
2014-06-07 14:37:35	jnoah	the purpose is to keep the python environment clean
2014-06-07 14:38:16	jnoah	non-python things are handled elsewhere, not by the virtualenv
2014-06-07 14:39:51	chance	chekkaa: you dont need to sign out
2014-06-07 14:40:00	chance	i think your doing google accounts wrong
2014-06-07 14:40:04	chance	you just click 'add account'
2014-06-07 14:40:09	chance	and you sign in once
2014-06-07 14:40:17	chance	then you can switch between any google account you've added
2014-06-07 14:40:29	chance	no signout/sign in mumbo jumbo
2014-06-07 14:41:39	chance	also, regarding your problem, chekkaa python your package uses C, C is system lib dependant. If you dont want system dependencies and only want to deal with a virtualenv, find a package which is pure python
2014-06-07 14:41:42	chance	otherwise your out of luck
2014-06-07 14:41:43	chance	or use docker
2014-06-07 14:46:24	chekkaa	chance: the multiple accounts usually works with email

2014-06-07 14:48:49	chance	middle click it
2014-06-07 14:48:51	chance	bam
2014-06-07 14:48:53	chance	2 drives open
2014-06-07 14:48:55	chance	also
2014-06-07 14:49:06	chance	the url is what matters
2014-06-07 14:49:15	chance	it adds &authuser=somenumber to your url
2014-06-07 14:49:27	chance	or sometimes /a/domain.goeshere.com/
2014-06-07 14:49:39	chance	so you can definitely have as many different account drives open as you want

2014-06-07 14:50:07	chance	the /a/domain/ one is for gapps accounts though, the authuser is for person

2014-06-07 14:53:46	chance	so your problem isnt multiple accounts with gdocs, its that you dont have permission

2014-06-07 14:55:45	chekkaa	but it doesn't let me switch to it
2014-06-07 14:56:07	chekkaa	so I can't access it unless I sign out of ALL 4 accounts
2014-06-07 14:56:15	chekkaa	then in again as nschekkaa
2014-06-07 14:56:53	chance	interesting
2014-06-07 14:57:20	chance	could probably fix it using delegated accounts

2014-06-08 12:33:02	mythmon	right now there is only one hard coded puzzle, and the solver is really basic.
2014-06-08 12:33:26	mythmon	it is a re-implementation of a game called slitherlink aka loopy.
2014-06-08 12:50:58	relud	mythmon: your lines aren't rendering at the right length
2014-06-08 12:51:24	relud	fx 29.01, windows 8.1
2014-06-08 12:58:58	mathuin	It's located way in the southwest of the browser window, adding unnecessary scrollbars to get there.  (Chrome 35.0.1916.114 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
2014-06-08 12:59:06	mathuin	Sorry, south_east_.
2014-06-08 12:59:12	mythmon	relud: screen shot?
2014-06-08 12:59:23	mythmon	mathuin: ah, yeah, i should fix that.
2014-06-08 12:59:26	 *	mythmon shakes his fist at chrome.
2014-06-08 12:59:38	mythmon	mathuin: it's because chrome hasn't unprefexed css transforms yet.
2014-06-08 12:59:44	mathuin	Huh!
2014-06-08 13:04:37	mythmon	relud: fx 29.0.1 on linux renders it fine. i'm curious what's going on for you.
2014-06-08 13:05:15	relud	i'm working on it

2014-06-08 13:06:04	relud	http://i.imgur.com/ldD4k4E.png
2014-06-08 13:06:13	relud	tried to get a good set of cases in there
2014-06-08 13:06:30	relud	it looks like all the yellow/black lines are too long in each direction
2014-06-08 13:06:31	mythmon	relud: resize your window a bit?
2014-06-08 13:06:36	mythmon	just to trigger the resize event.
2014-06-08 13:06:38	relud	it's at 100%, btw
2014-06-08 13:06:48	mythmon	good to know (i'm also at 100% nowadays)
2014-06-08 13:06:59	relud	the lines just get bolder when i do that
2014-06-08 13:07:20	mythmon	does the puzzle change size?
2014-06-08 13:07:28	mythmon	when appropriate, that is.
2014-06-08 13:07:29	relud	yeah, this is on my netbook, so no retina to deal with.
2014-06-08 13:07:39	relud	the puzzle does not change size
2014-06-08 13:07:53	mythmon	odd
2014-06-08 13:07:54	relud	it is always the right size
2014-06-08 13:08:08	relud	but as i zoom the button gets bigger, and the lines get bolder
2014-06-08 13:08:17	mythmon	it should scale so that it always fits. the lines should stay the same thickness, which makes them relatively bolder.
2014-06-08 13:08:17	mathuin	When I crank on Chrome's Ctrl-middlewheel the *dots* get bigger but the boxes remain the same size.
2014-06-08 13:08:39	relud	yeah, that's basically what's happening
2014-06-08 13:08:45	mythmon	oh. yeah, zoom (aka ctrl-middle wheel and ctrl plus) are just going to confuse it.
2014-06-08 13:08:52	jnoah	w manat

2014-06-08 13:09:16	relud	mythmon: if not ctrl plus, how should I zoom?
2014-06-08 13:09:20	mythmon	relud: reproduced in nightly win8.1
2014-06-08 13:09:36	relud	cool
2014-06-08 13:09:44	mythmon	relud: why do you want to zoom? i meant to resize the actual browser window.
2014-06-08 13:09:49	relud	oh
2014-06-08 13:09:51	relud	well
2014-06-08 13:10:15	relud	browser resize does 'the right thing'
2014-06-08 13:10:20	relud	quite well in fact
2014-06-08 13:11:11	mythmon	the click targets are voronoi regions. which i'm excited about.
2014-06-08 13:12:06	relud	the click areas work well with a touch screen
2014-06-08 13:14:14	mythmon	here i made the click regions visible with css. http://i.imgur.com/wm1KvpW.png
2014-06-08 13:14:33	mythmon	those regions are generated automatically by making a voronoi diagram of the centers of the faces and edges.
2014-06-08 13:14:48	bryon	jnoah: sorry, i have neither the time nor money to go to suds
2014-06-08 13:16:26	mythmon	mathuin: i pushed a fix to make it not off-center in chrome.
2014-06-08 13:16:59	mathuin	mythmon: the new version places the grid directly in the center, and the grid doesn't move with zooming.
2014-06-08 13:17:11	mythmon	mathuin: good. that is as intended.
2014-06-08 13:19:02	mathuin	It's a neat idea.
2014-06-08 13:19:28	mythmon	there are very few unique ideas in that page.
2014-06-08 13:20:00	mythmon	but thanks.
2014-06-08 13:20:15	mathuin	New to me so far.  I've never played the dot game though it does seem to make sense.  The concept of a solver would naturally follow once the rules were specified.  Is the goal to let the user attempt to solve the puzzle?
2014-06-08 13:20:23	mythmon	yeah.
2014-06-08 13:20:29	mythmon	if you click you can do that
2014-06-08 13:20:46	mythmon	yellow (undecided) -> black (decided yes) -> faded (decided no)
2014-06-08 13:20:55	mathuin	I didn't see anything happen when I thought I won.  hmm.
2014-06-08 13:20:57	mythmon	the goal is to make a single loop through the puzzle that satisfies all the numbers.
2014-06-08 13:21:02	mythmon	nothing happens when you win.
2014-06-08 13:21:14	mythmon	the only reason the solver stops is because it runs out of things to do.
2014-06-08 13:21:22	mythmon	it doesn't know the difference between winning and losing.
2014-06-08 13:21:34	mathuin	At least it can tell when it runs out of things to do!
2014-06-08 13:23:23	jnoah	bryon: ah :(

2014-06-08 16:34:21	lrr	you can still use a mouse...
2014-06-08 16:35:33	localhost00	Then I had him install KVIrc, but still need to sell him on the idea of idling in the channel.
2014-06-08 16:35:40	frostsnow	Hmm. It's been so long since I considered a mouse as necessarily vital to the human-computer interface... it feels like some old, legacy idea. How do you think I'd be able to help this?
2014-06-08 16:36:42	localhost00	Well, that isn’t what he originally asked me about..
2014-06-08 16:36:49	localhost00	Let me see if I can drag him back into the channel.
2014-06-08 16:38:31	localhost00	He wants to do something with network storage involving disk encryption, but also with very minimal hardware requirements.
2014-06-08 16:38:43	localhost00	I figured you might be better suited to help him.
2014-06-08 16:39:26	localhost00	But yes, frostsnow, there are very much “point-and-click” computer users around us who have an aversion to typing in commands.
2014-06-08 16:39:51	localhost00	(Well, parkerf is somewhat in the middle of that.)
2014-06-08 16:39:55	frostsnow	I know. I usually avoid them
2014-06-08 16:40:06	frostsnow	But, uh, maybe I can help him
2014-06-08 16:40:17	frostsnow	Network storage as in what? Encrypted NFS?
2014-06-08 16:40:31	localhost00	Um, well, let me see if I can get him back in here....
2014-06-08 16:42:10	frostsnow	Hmm, no rush. I actually just got back from Cornvallis and am trying to get my basic chores done and get settled in
2014-06-08 16:43:24	localhost00	:P He says he will get online tomorrow.
2014-06-08 16:43:35	frostsnow	okay. I won't be home until 6 mostl ikely
2014-06-08 16:43:56	frostsnow	I don't IRC at work. Tried it once. Spent all day talking or lurking. Bad for productivity :P

2014-06-08 20:33:44	mathuin	Emacs was written around being scripted in that way, so it does have something of an advantage.
2014-06-08 20:35:22	mathuin	Nonsequitre: sqlite3 does some wacky things.  The amalgamation is somewhat crazy.  Copying the first character off the commands and checking stuff like "if ((c=='b' && n>=3 && strncmp(azArg[0], "backup", n)==0)" is optimization I've never seen.

2014-06-09 18:47:55	mythmon	may i suggest trying it with gcc?
2014-06-09 18:48:04	muricula	I'll give that a
2014-06-09 18:48:05	muricula	 shot
2014-06-09 18:48:09	mythmon	are you compiling on a mac? they don't get gcc without hax, so you'd have to go to flip.

2014-06-09 19:47:57	bramwelt	What I mean to say is that Twisted does this _alot_. They use zope.interface and create Interfaces all over the place.
2014-06-09 19:48:11	bramwelt	There is not strict 'never extend objects' though.

2014-06-09 19:56:03	bramwelt	There should definitely be a check after realloc for 'word' to be not NULL.
2014-06-09 19:59:27	bramwelt	Also, the initial assignment of malloc should be cast to (char*).
2014-06-09 20:09:12	chance	bramwelt: yeah, but they're still rather un-enforcable
2014-06-09 20:10:30	chance	it seems like during the compile to byteface, during the interpretation you could do checking for proper interface implementation

2014-06-09 21:01:35	mythmon	localhost00: idk, however you get the name from the row.
2014-06-09 21:01:50	localhost00	My code was just assuming csv was just a list of lists.
2014-06-09 21:02:06	mythmon	localhost00: setdefault is actually "get, and if it isn't there, set this and then return it"
2014-06-09 21:02:16	mythmon	localhost00: ah. mine assumed it was a list of dicts.
2014-06-09 21:02:21	localhost00	I see.
2014-06-09 21:02:22	mythmon	csv might do that.

2014-06-10 10:31:46	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: oh look. Civ5 and all it's expansions now run on linux and are 75% off today.
2014-06-10 10:31:48	mathuin	Do they really run on Linux, or are they just wine'd?
2014-06-10 10:32:05	mythmon	they are advertised on steam's site as running on steamos, which means linux.
2014-06-10 10:32:22	mythmon	i doubt it's wine.
2014-06-10 10:32:23	mathuin	I bought CivV, wonder if I can update it.
2014-06-10 10:32:39	mythmon	you should be able to install it on linux now without rebuying it (if you bought it on steam)
2014-06-10 10:33:21	mathuin	A number of Humble Bundle games claimed linux and steam and failed on the wine score.
2014-06-10 10:35:33	mathuin	Awww, you can't even run the Steam UI on VNC nowadays (no GLX support).
2014-06-10 10:35:58	nibalizer	oh man
2014-06-10 10:36:03	nibalizer	i played like full price for that game
2014-06-10 10:36:10	mathuin	Me too, when it came out. :-)
2014-06-10 10:36:18	nibalizer	mythmon: do you know if I bought it in the mac/win days if i auto-upgrade to linux?
2014-06-10 10:36:27	nibalizer	assuming steam?
2014-06-10 10:37:17	jordane	mathuin: hmm. the internet seems to talk more about civ5 on wine, but firaxis seems to claim linux support directly.
2014-06-10 10:37:20	mythmon	nibalizer: the games i have on steam that support multiple platforms are that i own the game on any platform.
2014-06-10 10:37:29	mythmon	so I bought it on windows, but then played it on linux, for example.
2014-06-10 10:37:48	bryon	mythmon: civ5 on linux now? neat!
2014-06-10 10:37:50	mythmon	nibalizer: so you don't own civ for mac/win, you own steam, and can download win/mac binaries.
2014-06-10 10:37:53	jordane	fwiw I've never heard of valve calling wine support linux support
2014-06-10 10:37:58	mythmon	jordane: this is brand new.
2014-06-10 10:38:11	mythmon	also, it seems to be high profile. i doubt valve would have let them get away with a wine port.
2014-06-10 10:38:14	jordane	mythmon: yeah, that is what it seems.
2014-06-10 10:38:21	mathuin	jordane: Last time I tried I only saw it on wine, and while I haven't seen valve call wine support Linux support I *have* seen Humble Bundle do it.
2014-06-10 10:38:43	jordane	mathuin: yeah, it used to be wine only, and no mac either.
2014-06-10 10:39:04	jordane	and humble bundle doing it makes me sad
2014-06-10 10:39:22	jordane	but I've mostly ignored them since they started doing non-indie/linux bundles.
2014-06-10 10:39:52	mathuin	I keep an eye out for stuff that's on my steam wishlist.
2014-06-10 10:40:04	mathuin	Got a $15 game for $1, realized it was worth $2, so that was good.
2014-06-10 10:40:12	jordane	nifty
2014-06-10 10:40:25	jordane	I'd log in to steam if I ever had free time again.
2014-06-10 10:40:29	nibalizer	woot
2014-06-10 10:40:52	mathuin	Got it on my phone.
2014-06-10 10:40:54	mythmon	jordane: yeah, you're probably short on time nowadays?
2014-06-10 10:40:56	mathuin	(the steam app)

2014-06-10 14:00:55	muricula	No, it's in the class, I just wasn't thinking straight
2014-06-10 14:00:59	drkitty	oh
2014-06-10 14:01:00	drkitty	okay
2014-06-10 14:01:27	muricula	but I'm not sure how to delete a bst node with two children
2014-06-10 14:02:53	drkitty	If x is the node to delete, move the rightmost child of x->left to where x used to be.
2014-06-10 14:03:11	drkitty	(That's one way of doing it.)
2014-06-10 14:03:16	jordane	muricula: http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Binary_search_tree/Removal has some helpful pictures
2014-06-10 14:03:56	muricula	I'm looking at that right now
2014-06-10 14:04:21	drkitty	Actually, depending on whether identical elements go on the right or left, you might need to move x->right's leftmost child.
2014-06-10 14:04:30	muricula	I think that one
2014-06-10 14:04:57	drkitty	actually I'm not sure it matters
2014-06-10 14:05:40	drkitty	I wish I remembered this better.

2014-06-10 14:57:23	lrr	muricula: for BST, if removing a node that has 2 children, then the new parent node gets left most value of the right child's children
2014-06-10 14:57:30	lrr	if i remember my BST correctly
2014-06-10 14:57:59	jordane	lrr: yep.
2014-06-10 14:58:14	lrr	so recurse to the left node of the right child's children, which if the right most child has no children, then the value is the right child
2014-06-10 14:58:50	lrr	has no left children*

2014-06-10 20:24:44	chekkaa	only $7.49
2014-06-10 20:24:48	chekkaa	edunham: ^
2014-06-10 20:28:28	jnoah	(civ v)++
2014-06-10 20:28:33	jnoah	i have it, but yet to play
2014-06-10 20:28:42	illuminatedgeek	are unmanaged switches allowed on the dorm ethernet jacks? I seem to remember hearing that this wasn't okay but I can't find anything on the site that says it's not
2014-06-10 20:28:44	jnoah	edunham, chekkaa start a game?
2014-06-10 20:29:01	edunham	jnoah: uhh i'd have to buy it...
2014-06-10 20:29:03	chekkaa	jnoah: I actually didn't buy it because I don't need more games atm
2014-06-10 20:36:13	jnoah	lol
2014-06-10 20:36:28	jnoah	i've owned it since about the time it came out, but have had no one to play with :/
2014-06-10 20:53:02	Odysimus	illuminatedgeek: I'm not sure a switch will work without something to handle routing and NAT. I think the management on the resnet switches only assigns a single IP per port
2014-06-10 20:54:34	Odysimus	I would say for an answer from someone with some authority ask in #OSU-ResNet
2014-06-10 20:59:16	bryon	chekkaa: it's a gooooood deal tho
2014-06-10 20:59:23	bryon	get it now, and then play it later
2014-06-10 21:00:18	chekkaa	bryon: that logic right there accounts for half of my game library
2014-06-10 21:01:38	jnoah	chekkaa: or buy it tonight and play it tonight :)
2014-06-10 21:01:46	jnoah	(unless of course you need to be studying)
2014-06-10 21:02:25	bryon	most of my game library is humble bundles
2014-06-10 21:02:49	jnoah	(humble bundle)--
2014-06-10 21:03:09	jnoah	they've gone so far downhill, it's kinda sad :(
2014-06-10 21:03:21	jnoah	originally though, yes, they were fantastic
2014-06-10 21:03:44	bryon	yeah
2014-06-10 21:04:46	mythmon	illuminatedgeek: unmanaged ports are interesting on resnet.
2014-06-10 21:05:11	mythmon	all the things connected to the switch would need to be registered just as if they were plugged in without a switch
2014-06-10 21:05:18	mythmon	mainly because that's how switches work.
2014-06-10 21:19:43	chance	illuminatedgeek: they're fine, you can use switches/routers w/e
2014-06-10 21:20:07	chance	as mythmon has said, you still need to have them registered, as they still check mac addresses of traffic
2014-06-10 21:21:54	mythmon	in particular, you have to have the *computers* registered. not the switch.
2014-06-10 21:23:09	lrr	^^
2014-06-10 21:49:43	chance	mhm
2014-06-10 22:43:11	pwnguin	wat, civ5 on linux?
2014-06-10 22:43:44	jnoah	yep
2014-06-10 22:43:50	pwnguin	when did that happen?
2014-06-10 22:43:56	jnoah	recently
2014-06-10 22:44:04	jnoah	as in today? or somewhere around today
2014-06-10 22:44:05	pwnguin	i wonder if that humble bundle includes it
2014-06-10 22:44:19	jnoah	sid bundle? no, i don't think so
2014-06-10 22:44:27	pwnguin	well that sucks
2014-06-10 22:44:28	jnoah	(unless it was a set cost addon to the bundle)
2014-06-10 22:46:03	pwnguin	i guess i should install steam and find out
2014-06-10 22:53:33	mythmon	pwnguin: also, civ 3-5 are heavily discounted
2014-06-10 22:53:45	mythmon	you can get civ5, all it's expansions, and all the dlc for ~$20
2014-06-10 22:54:29	pwnguin	mythmon: but i already bought a sid meier bundle thing with civ 5 =/
2014-06-10 22:54:47	pwnguin	its like a 'princple of the thing' thing man
2014-06-10 22:55:06	mythmon	sure, but not all the other stuff.
2014-06-10 22:55:29	mythmon	i think even if you had the game and an expansion, the bundle is still more economical then buying the pieces individually.
2014-06-10 22:55:43	mythmon	now, that assumes you want the stuff.

2014-06-10 23:06:27	pwnguin	jnoah: it would appear i do get the linux version
2014-06-10 23:06:38	jnoah	woot, nice
2014-06-10 23:06:53	jnoah	we should play some time (but not tonight...it's a bit late to start)
2014-06-10 23:07:14	pwnguin	but ive got mario kart and pikmin 3
2014-06-10 23:10:18	chance	so, what do people recommend for dynamic dns services these days?
2014-06-10 23:10:35	chance	mostly looking to have ssh access to my mac mini this summer incase i want to grab something off if it when i get to SF
2014-06-10 23:11:05	mythmon	I recommend considering if you really have an ip that ever changes.
2014-06-10 23:11:23	jnoah	heh
2014-06-10 23:11:28	mythmon	also, taking the mini with you.
2014-06-10 23:11:47	jnoah	i use no-ip for my home stuff...but i really am not a fan of it, dyndns went away and it's all i knew
2014-06-10 23:12:00	chance	mythmon: leaving it for the gf
2014-06-10 23:12:06	chance	dont need it, getting a more powerful macbook
2014-06-10 23:12:11	chance	dont want to bring a monitor neither
2014-06-10 23:12:12	mythmon	my comcast connection has changed ips twice in two years, and once was because i got a new modem.
2014-06-10 23:12:32	pwnguin	chance: are you driving to cali?
2014-06-10 23:12:35	chance	no
2014-06-10 23:12:46	chance	mythmon: if ive got my vps, can i just point a subdomain at my mini?
2014-06-10 23:12:53	chance	i think dns is tied to a droplet.
2014-06-10 23:13:14	pwnguin	linode will let me publish whatever i want
2014-06-10 23:13:21	pwnguin	you can try it now though
2014-06-10 23:13:35	pwnguin	see if you can publish A records for a comcast IP
2014-06-10 23:13:37	mythmon	chance: you can point subdomains anywhere you like.
2014-06-10 23:13:50	chance	hmmm
2014-06-10 23:13:51	pwnguin	i mean, that'd be a serious misfeature if you couldn't
2014-06-10 23:13:56	mythmon	and if you cant, you need a better dns solution.
2014-06-10 23:14:16	pwnguin	like, google apps requires some records
2014-06-10 23:14:19	chance	so if i create an a record for mini.chancez.net and point it to my ip, think that'll work?
2014-06-10 23:14:23	jnoah	chance: no-ip it's shitty ( you have to click an "I still use the service" link every month), but it's free
2014-06-10 23:14:30	mythmon	chance: exantly
2014-06-10 23:14:36	chance	looks like it dont care the IP
2014-06-10 23:14:40	pwnguin	chance: that will work until your ip changes or the power goes out
2014-06-10 23:14:46	chance	did i get my dns terminolgy right?
2014-06-10 23:14:48	mythmon	pwnguin: my co
2014-06-10 23:14:50	jnoah	and they have a client you run to keep it up to date
2014-06-10 23:14:51	mythmon	gah.
2014-06-10 23:14:55	jnoah	part of the free service
2014-06-10 23:15:06	mythmon	my comcast keeps ips through restarts.
2014-06-10 23:15:25	pwnguin	mythmon: but does your computer wake on power
2014-06-10 23:15:29	jnoah	mine does as well, but it does change here and there for seeminly no reason
2014-06-10 23:15:36	mythmon	chance: close enough.
2014-06-10 23:15:41	chance	i *really* need to take the time to learn about dns
2014-06-10 23:15:51	pwnguin	there isn't much to it
2014-06-10 23:15:54	chance	like i only vaguely know what a record/cnames are
2014-06-10 23:16:02	mythmon	pwnguin: yes, if it was on before.
2014-06-10 23:16:05	pwnguin	its basically the worlds first distributed database
2014-06-10 23:16:07	mythmon	it also has a ups.
2014-06-10 23:16:21	pwnguin	mythmon: but you're also not chance
2014-06-10 23:16:38	pwnguin	hell, until a few months ago I didn't own a ups
2014-06-10 23:16:43	pwnguin	!fire pacific-power
2014-06-10 23:16:51	mythmon	chance: A is a hardlink, CNAME is a softlink
2014-06-10 23:17:08	chance	thats kind of how i viewed it
2014-06-10 23:17:15	pwnguin	but there's so much more
2014-06-10 23:17:18	mythmon	pwnguin: sure, but there will be a human neat by who wants it turned on.
2014-06-10 23:17:27	pwnguin	there's txt records, which are just random nosql crap
2014-06-10 23:17:45	pwnguin	there's srv records, which are basically formalized txt records for services other than mail
2014-06-10 23:17:56	chance	does a cname have higher 'precedence' than an arecord?
2014-06-10 23:17:57	mythmon	and SRV, which is sadly under used.
2014-06-10 23:17:58	pwnguin	there's mx records, which predates those and are basically srv records for mail
2014-06-10 23:18:04	chance	or maybe its something to do with caching..
2014-06-10 23:18:12	mythmon	chance: neither.
2014-06-10 23:18:23	chance	i have a * cname pointing to an a record which is my VPS IP
2014-06-10 23:18:38	pwnguin	thats probably gonna f you up
2014-06-10 23:18:52	mythmon	technically, having both an A and a cname is an error.
2014-06-10 23:19:08	chance	i just added an a record to my mini's IP (mini.chancez.net) which is probably conflicting
2014-06-10 23:19:18	mythmon	but wildcards are different.
2014-06-10 23:19:27	chance	wait having both in general is an error?
2014-06-10 23:19:30	chance	how to subdomain then?
2014-06-10 23:19:33	mythmon	no, it should beat the wildcard.
2014-06-10 23:19:56	chance	ok
2014-06-10 23:19:58	pwnguin	CNAME www.pwnguin.net pwnguin.net
2014-06-10 23:20:06	pwnguin	A pwnguin.net whatevermyipis
2014-06-10 23:20:12	chance	right
2014-06-10 23:20:17	pwnguin	that's fine, just dont A www
2014-06-10 23:20:19	chance	does this look okay? http://imgur.com/g5rs2dS
2014-06-10 23:20:37	mythmon	yeah, that's fine.
2014-06-10 23:20:50	chance	okay, and now i wait
2014-06-10 23:20:50	mythmon	also, you don't have a wildcard there.
2014-06-10 23:20:53	chance	i removed it
2014-06-10 23:20:56	mythmon	ah
2014-06-10 23:21:01	mythmon	you probably don't want it anyways.
2014-06-10 23:21:17	mythmon	you shouldn't have to wait long
2014-06-10 23:21:18	chance	yeah, i just used it so i didnt have to add records when i put things up on subdomains randomly
2014-06-10 23:21:25	mythmon	and if you do, well... namecheap++
2014-06-10 23:21:32	chance	i use namecheap :)
2014-06-10 23:21:34	pwnguin	your zone file doesn't match the the html version
2014-06-10 23:21:48	chance	cause the wildcard?
2014-06-10 23:21:56	mythmon	pwnguin: he said he removed the *, so pretty sure that is just pre-save.
2014-06-10 23:21:57	pwnguin	there's no mini record in your zone file per screenshot
2014-06-10 23:22:06	pwnguin	ah
2014-06-10 23:22:08	chance	zonefile might not be up to date according to their server?
2014-06-10 23:22:13	mythmon	chance: i mean using namecheap's NS servers.
2014-06-10 23:22:53	chance	shit, checking namecheap is smart
2014-06-10 23:22:54	pwnguin	chance: now make a subdomain you.have.used.all.your.chancez.net ;)
2014-06-10 23:22:59	chance	i forgot that my domain name is expiring
2014-06-10 23:23:01	mythmon	for me they tend to update quite quick. i assume they do push instead of waiting for the TTL to timeout.
2014-06-10 23:23:35	mythmon	btw, i played about 70 turns of civ5 on linux tonight. it works just fine, and isn't wine.
2014-06-10 23:23:48	chance	old debit card on file too :<
2014-06-10 23:23:53	pwnguin	now i wonder if civ4 is on steamos
2014-06-10 23:23:57	mythmon	yes
2014-06-10 23:23:58	mythmon	and civ3
2014-06-10 23:24:13	pwnguin	well then
2014-06-10 23:24:26	mythmon	oh, wait
2014-06-10 23:24:27	mythmon	i lied
2014-06-10 23:24:33	pwnguin	it has an install button
2014-06-10 23:24:35	mythmon	only civ5 was ported, sorry.
2014-06-10 23:24:43	mythmon	really? interesting.
2014-06-10 23:24:48	mythmon	they aren't advertising it on the game page.
2014-06-10 23:25:31	 *	mythmon sleeps
2014-06-10 23:26:04	pwnguin	this may call for an expenditure of personal leave in the near future
2014-06-10 23:28:57	chance	what it the .pw tld?
2014-06-10 23:29:14	pwnguin	its obviously where i upload stolen passwords

2014-06-11 12:02:07	chance	can i list multiple 'locations' in nginx to proxy/rewrite towards?
2014-06-11 12:02:48	mythmon	chance: "Location" in nginx is a way to define a rule.
2014-06-11 12:02:57	mythmon	"when the location is X, use these rules."
2014-06-11 12:03:06	mythmon	so, you can only proxy a location to one place.
2014-06-11 12:03:13	mythmon	but you can proxy two locations to two places.
2014-06-11 12:04:03	mythmon	this is my favorite way though: https://gist.github.com/mythmon/1cd9d0095d8ed48577a3
2014-06-11 12:04:17	chance	yeah, so basically i proxyed /containers to localhost:8080
2014-06-11 12:04:29	chance	but its 404ing on /static/containers.js
2014-06-11 12:04:37	chance	so i need to also proxy /static
2014-06-11 12:04:38	mythmon	yeah
2014-06-11 12:04:42	mythmon	eh...
2014-06-11 12:04:45	mythmon	just make a new name
2014-06-11 12:04:53	mythmon	don't try and proxy subdomains, it's usually painful.
2014-06-11 12:05:16	chance	in fact, i have a bunch of things 404ing
2014-06-11 12:05:19	chance	like /api
2014-06-11 12:05:32	chance	cause that's also something i need to proxy
2014-06-11 12:05:34	chance	T.T
2014-06-11 12:05:42	chance	there's no subdomains
2014-06-11 12:06:24	chance	aha, regex!
2014-06-11 12:06:33	mythmon	why not use subdomains?
2014-06-11 12:06:39	chance	cause these are docker containers
2014-06-11 12:06:43	mythmon	so?
2014-06-11 12:06:55	chance	well i guess thats not a reason
2014-06-11 12:06:55	mythmon	foo.localhost
2014-06-11 12:07:12	mythmon	or, in my case, just foo
2014-06-11 12:07:21	mythmon	really, i promise, trying to proxy subdomains like this is a huge pain.
2014-06-11 12:07:26	mythmon	most apps don't work that way.
2014-06-11 12:07:35	mythmon	WSGI can do it, but only because WSGI is special.
2014-06-11 12:08:30	chance	good point.
2014-06-11 12:08:45	chance	now i need to add another cname to DO
2014-06-11 12:08:52	chance	thats why, i didnt want to do that before.
2014-06-11 12:08:56	chance	cause i removed the wildcard lol
2014-06-11 12:26:22	mythmon	lazy
2014-06-11 12:30:37	spectralsun	chance: have you tried pentadactyl?
2014-06-11 12:32:04	chance	no

2014-06-11 14:05:35	pwnguin	is there a function i can use for this?
2014-06-11 14:07:28	pwnguin	so i can have a reusable formula
2014-06-11 14:10:36	pwnguin	i could use a huge ugly if else tree
2014-06-11 14:11:47	pwnguin	MATCH may do the trick

2014-06-11 14:24:56	mythmon	pwnguin: VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP?
2014-06-11 14:25:02	mythmon	MATCH sounds right oo.
2014-06-11 14:26:14	relud	I've done it with FILTER and MATCH
2014-06-11 14:26:23	relud	s/MATCH/MAX/
2014-06-11 14:26:23	@hamper	relud actually meant: I've done it with FILTER and MAX
2014-06-11 14:26:41	relud	mythmon: i read what you said while typing, and screwed up my nouns.
2014-06-11 14:27:59	mythmon	relud: i think that means I win.
2014-06-11 14:30:07	pwnguin	also
2014-06-11 14:30:24	pwnguin	what do i use for estimating failure rates of hard drives
2014-06-11 14:30:53	pwnguin	google's paper makes it clear that vendor / model matter more than age
2014-06-11 14:31:06	mythmon	but they didn't reveal vendor/model, right?
2014-06-11 14:31:10	pwnguin	yep
2014-06-11 14:31:32	mythmon	didn't they also learn that when SMART said there was a failure, it was very likely to be right?
2014-06-11 14:31:41	pwnguin	this doesn't help me
2014-06-11 14:31:42	jordane	yep
2014-06-11 14:32:46	mythmon	pwnguin: does the OSL have enough historical data well kept enough to do some statistics on it?
2014-06-11 14:32:52	pwnguin	ha
2014-06-11 14:33:04	pwnguin	i doubt we have sufficient data points
2014-06-11 14:33:09	mythmon	you could start recording data now.
2014-06-11 14:33:32	pwnguin	and in five years, i'll know how accurate my estimate for 5 year old drives will be ;)
2014-06-11 14:34:55	jordane	well, assuming you have new drives as of now :)
2014-06-11 14:35:08	pwnguin	ok, more than five years

2014-06-11 14:45:38	fyrexus	So I have this weird issue where I can CP files to my usb thumbdrives but I do not have permissions in the GUI folders... this is Linux Mint btw. Does anyone have a solution?
2014-06-11 14:46:03	lrr	fyrexus: what user are you using cp on the cli with?
2014-06-11 14:46:06	relud	mythmon: you were right, btw. vlookup, hlookup, and match all do the job great. meanwhile filter isn't even a function in libre office.
2014-06-11 14:46:10	fyrexus	Mint needs to allow root access from GUI interface!
2014-06-11 14:46:19	fyrexus	lrr: uhmm
2014-06-11 14:46:20	lrr	fyrexus: or you need to not be using root?

2014-06-11 14:47:02	chekkaa	fyrexus: thumbdrives work for me without root?
2014-06-11 14:47:10	chekkaa	what exactly are you doing?
2014-06-11 14:47:33	lrr	it also depends on how you mounted the usb drive
2014-06-11 14:47:38	fyrexus	Wait a second! Now it's working
2014-06-11 14:47:44	fyrexus	It doesn't work on my other Thumbdrives though
2014-06-11 14:47:47	chekkaa	hm
2014-06-11 14:47:52	fyrexus	is there a way to lock thumbdrives from write access? what in the owrld
2014-06-11 14:47:56	chekkaa	perhaps a filesystem issue?
2014-06-11 14:48:13	chekkaa	maybe it has weird permissions?
2014-06-11 14:48:21	fyrexus	I think a reboot fixed everything ._.

2014-06-11 18:53:59	frostsnow	There are different kinds?

2014-06-11 18:55:24	frostsnow	But FIIK if that's true or not
2014-06-11 18:55:54	lrr	not best, but in terms of ease of acquisition it's pretty good
2014-06-11 18:55:58	frostsnow	Sadly, no nearby RadioShacks... there's an Office Max, but they didn't even carry SATA Data cablesl think they'd carry Thermal Paste? There's also a Freddies somewhat nearby.

2014-06-11 20:12:35	frostsnow	Yeah, but aren't primitives passed by value, so self.location would always need updating?
2014-06-11 20:12:37	spectralsun	let me see if that copies into a tuble
2014-06-11 20:12:42	spectralsun	tuple*
2014-06-11 20:12:47	spectralsun	or if it points
2014-06-11 20:13:16	frostsnow	Oh, and, uh, I don't know if you'd need one set of parenthesis or two >.>
2014-06-11 20:13:38	chekkaa	spectralsun: that's what's in mine already, and self.location always refers to what the object was instantiated with

2014-06-11 20:15:52	chekkaa	so you can just refer to it without ()?
2014-06-11 20:15:54	spectralsun	yep
2014-06-11 20:15:54	chekkaa	:o
2014-06-11 20:15:56	chekkaa	fancy
2014-06-11 20:15:59	spectralsun	python++
2014-06-11 20:16:06	chekkaa	I'll try it out
2014-06-11 20:16:58	spectralsun	chekkaa: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/forms.py#L5857
2014-06-11 20:17:04	spectralsun	this is a django Form class
2014-06-11 20:17:07	spectralsun	and you can do
2014-06-11 20:17:10	spectralsun	the_form.data
2014-06-11 20:17:17	spectralsun	and as you see that actually calls a function
2014-06-11 20:17:38	chekkaa	it works!

2014-06-11 20:17:41	spectralsun	:)
2014-06-11 20:18:44	chekkaa	spectralsun: is there a way to set location?
2014-06-11 20:18:58	chekkaa	self.location = (0, 0) or something
2014-06-11 20:18:59	spectralsun	chekkaa: you technically already did, on the class
2014-06-11 20:19:02	spectralsun	it is set a method
2014-06-11 20:19:04	spectralsun	no
2014-06-11 20:19:11	spectralsun	that would either override the method or cause problems
2014-06-11 20:19:20	spectralsun	monkey patching
2014-06-11 20:19:23	spectralsun	if it doesnt crash
2014-06-11 20:19:40	spectralsun	because you're changing it from a magical function that behaves like a var
2014-06-11 20:19:50	spectralsun	to a var (tuple, in this case)
2014-06-11 20:19:53	chekkaa	so it's doomed to be read only
2014-06-11 20:19:57	spectralsun	yes
2014-06-11 20:20:00	chekkaa	and if I want write, I must make a setter
2014-06-11 20:20:09	spectralsun	im not 100% sure
2014-06-11 20:20:16	spectralsun	to the best of my knowledge its RO
2014-06-11 20:20:29	spectralsun	but i have not worked with @property enough to say, or offer more indepth hacks
2014-06-11 20:20:58	spectralsun	chekkaa: that is sane in this case
2014-06-11 20:21:06	spectralsun	especially since you are unpacking a tuple
2014-06-11 20:21:08	spectralsun	in your class
2014-06-11 20:21:13	spectralsun	and storing it as self.x and self.y
2014-06-11 20:21:15	chance	properties are ways to use functions to interact with an attribute
2014-06-11 20:21:24	chance	its a good way to encapsulate behavior of assignment
2014-06-11 20:21:35	chance	usually you store values like self._x and self._y
2014-06-11 20:21:54	chance	and then use properties to assign to those, and retrieve them
2014-06-11 20:22:06	spectralsun	it doesn't really make a difference, a single underscore is just supposed to be like "please dont touch this directly"
2014-06-11 20:22:08	spectralsun	it has no effect
2014-06-11 20:22:51	spectralsun	chance: there might be some kind of extra thing you can do
2014-06-11 20:23:00	spectralsun	where you could pass args to a property?
2014-06-11 20:23:20	spectralsun	im not quite sure how that would look if so
2014-06-11 20:23:38	chance	spectralsun: well you might need to do  assignment differently then how = is used
2014-06-11 20:23:52	chance	its useful for caching as an example
2014-06-11 20:24:35	chance	if you have a hard to compute value, rather than computing it everytime, you store it in some kind of cache or just as an instance variable
2014-06-11 20:24:49	chance	and you can then use the getter to define when its fine to recompute
2014-06-11 20:25:57	chekkaa	it looks like I can use self.location = property(getter, setter)
2014-06-11 20:26:03	chekkaa	define a getter and setter function
2014-06-11 20:26:09	chekkaa	then it works like a property normally
2014-06-11 20:26:24	spectralsun	wheeeee
2014-06-11 20:26:34	spectralsun	good to know
2014-06-11 20:26:54	chekkaa	"self.location" invokes the getter, and "self.location = value" invokes the setter
2014-06-11 20:27:30	chekkaa	https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property
2014-06-11 20:29:09	chekkaa	alternatively, use @property for the getter
2014-06-11 20:29:20	chekkaa	and use @x.setter for the setter
2014-06-11 20:29:34	chekkaa	or @location.setter in my case
2014-06-11 20:34:48	chance	yeah, i never understood why they put so many different ways to do that in the stdlib
2014-06-11 20:35:19	chance	but meh.
2014-06-11 20:35:28	chance	but at least you've got options
2014-06-11 20:35:32	chekkaa	it works
2014-06-11 20:35:53	chekkaa	I'm can deal with occasional with transparent getters and setters

2014-06-12 09:56:29	drkitty	I just changed the branches a git remote tracks by using `git remote set-branches $remote $branch $branch ...`. The remote-tracking branches that weren't in the list are no longer tracked (when I fetch the remote, they don't get fetched), but they aren't gone. `git remote prune $remote` doesn't work. Is there any way to get rid of the old remote tracking branches all at once? I don't want to have to `git branch -dr $branch` each one.
2014-06-12 09:56:53	drkitty	No one on the Internet seems to use `git remote set-branches`.

2014-06-12 18:40:13	jnoah	it doesn't really matter actually, but I usually find that method to be easier (more room for your hands). I actually but most everything on the mobo first. Unless it covers up screw holes
2014-06-12 18:40:48	frostsnow	Hmm okay. So it doesn't really matter too much. Good to know.
2014-06-12 18:41:00	frostsnow	It's the little things that fuck you up

2014-06-12 18:59:33	mythmon	as long as you fill all the screw holes, you should be fine.

2014-06-12 19:06:49	frostsnow	Interesting. Sets-sizes: 4, 8, 2, 4, 24, 12, and 8
2014-06-12 19:06:58	frostsnow	With one set of 8 looking identical to the 12-set

2014-06-12 19:07:15	frostsnow	I presume the 12-set is the one they want me to screw my Motherboard in with
2014-06-12 19:07:19	mythmon	yeah.
2014-06-12 19:07:25	frostsnow	8 is out; it's too few for a full-size ATX

2014-06-12 19:07:37	mythmon	if you take a picture, i could probably tell you what they all are.

2014-06-12 19:13:19	frostsnow	It helps to put the I/O panel in first

2014-06-12 19:13:53	chance	go on...
2014-06-12 19:13:53	mythmon	well, you could. there are browser apis to interface with gamepads.
2014-06-12 19:14:05	mythmon	also there are programs that map game pads to keys.
2014-06-12 19:15:57	mythmon	so if the game is written to support gamepads, a ps4 controller could be used.
2014-06-12 19:16:04	chance	well i dont know that it is
2014-06-12 19:16:10	frostsnow	No, TV dinner, go away please I am computering
2014-06-12 19:16:44	mythmon	chance: hmm?
2014-06-12 19:17:36	chance	i dont think the game is designed with gamepads in mind
2014-06-12 19:17:55	mythmon	it's unlikely
2014-06-12 19:18:13	mythmon	so you fall back to option two, which is to get a program that translates gamepad buttons to keyboard keys.

2014-06-13 13:52:52	pwnguin	for some postgresql strings
2014-06-13 13:53:38	nibalizer	search is only faster than sort when you've pre-indexed
2014-06-13 13:53:47	nibalizer	so throw it in an indexer
2014-06-13 14:05:00	mythmon	grep still pretty fast.

2014-06-13 14:08:35	deanj	TIL new_list = map(func, list) is appx 10x faster than new_list = [func(x) for x in list]
2014-06-13 14:08:46	deanj	For my specific use case anyways.
2014-06-13 14:09:29	nibalizer	thats cool
2014-06-13 14:09:34	nibalizer	ill try to remember that
2014-06-13 14:26:23	pwnguin	well, the complaint isnt that its slow
2014-06-13 14:26:38	pwnguin	its that its really noisy when there's no hits on 99 percent of the repos

2014-06-15 21:39:13	bryon	up to x%?
2014-06-15 21:40:18	pwnguin	they do not match the 403b/457
2014-06-15 21:40:23	pwnguin	they have a separate pension for this
2014-06-15 21:41:05	pwnguin	i get a defined benefit plan years of service * average salary * multiplier
2014-06-15 21:42:00	pwnguin	if you have a MBA in finance you can probably do some present value analysis, but for the most part i just estimate it as what they put in: an additional 12 percent of salary
2014-06-15 21:44:18	pwnguin	of course, there's  a set of people who basically advocate for defaulting on that, so it's hardly a guarenteed thing
2014-06-15 21:46:16	bryon	heh
2014-06-15 21:47:26	bryon	when i was at wsu, they'd match 100% of up to x% of your pre-taxed contribution
2014-06-15 21:47:29	pwnguin	so no, no "match" for classified staff, i just chose defer that much because a) i can b) taxes c) tricking student loans
2014-06-15 21:47:49	bryon	c) gives you the most points

2014-06-16 11:21:31	chekkaa	all right, so I just decided that I don't like implicit returns in ruby
2014-06-16 11:22:14	chekkaa	a function that works on some logic paths returns weird stuff in slightly different situations
2014-06-16 11:22:14	jordane	chekkaa: yeah. rubyists abuse the hell out of implicit returns.
2014-06-16 11:23:00	mathuin	Wow.  That's insanity.
2014-06-16 11:23:35	mathuin	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1064159/implicit-return-values-in-ruby -- the second codeblock in the accepted answer scares me.  You can tack a command on a block terminator?
2014-06-16 11:24:41	jordane	mathuin: yeah, it is fairly common.
2014-06-16 11:25:12	jordane	a lot of rubyists use .collect,map, etc to generate some kind of hash/array, and then want to immediately operate on that object.
2014-06-16 11:25:52	mathuin	And they're in so much of a rush that they can't explicitly assign anything? :-)
2014-06-16 11:25:55	jordane	things like list.collect{ |o| o if o.name == name }.someothermethod
2014-06-16 11:26:17	jordane	mathuin: why explicitly assign anything when YOUR CODE DOES MAGIC?!?
2014-06-16 11:26:26	jordane	until it does the wrong magic.
2014-06-16 11:27:00	mathuin	There's so much magic in ruby I think they teach it at Hogwarts.

2014-06-16 11:38:32	terrellt	It should be noted that chances are there's some refactoring to be done if you're tacking on things like that.
2014-06-16 11:39:24	terrellt	At least if you're using multi-line blocks. What jordane said is pretty common, you just have to know where to draw the line.
2014-06-16 11:39:57	jordane	yeah, do || end.method blocks are much more likely to be bad form.
2014-06-16 11:41:47	terrellt	We have a ruby meeting every week over here at the library, and sometimes there are coding challenges. Usually there's a one line answer, with a disclaimer at the end, "this pull request would get denied."
2014-06-16 11:42:44	jordane	heh
2014-06-16 11:44:19	terrellt	ruby++
2014-06-16 11:45:56	terrellt	I haven't decided where I sit with implicit returns. It saves some time, but there are circumstances where you either explicitly return or wrap your head around something complicated. For instance, I hate having to recognize implicit returns in branches.

2014-06-16 13:52:47	drkitty	It's only really useful if you want to fetch some branches from a remote but the remote has a lot of branches you don't care about.

2014-06-18 12:00:17	terrellt	jnoah: I don't know much about virtualenv. Crash course?
2014-06-18 12:01:00	terrellt	lrr: What do you mean reimplementing them? OpenSSL is part of the standard library, and is just a wrapper on OpenSSL.
2014-06-18 12:02:27	terrellt	jnoah: A quick look makes virtualenv look a lot like a problem solved in Ruby by bundler, or if you'd like to maintain total environment dependency rbenv/rvm/chruby/etc.
2014-06-18 12:02:41	terrellt	environment isolation, not dependency.
2014-06-18 12:03:12	mathuin	terrellt: it's actually more than that I think, unless bundler now handles mixed packages (both local binaries and pure ruby)
2014-06-18 12:03:36	terrellt	mathuin: There are gems that package system binaries, if that's what you mean.
2014-06-18 12:04:02	mathuin	executables and libraries?  Nice.
2014-06-18 12:04:18	terrellt	Most don't, because it tends to inflate the gem.
2014-06-18 12:04:34	terrellt	And bundler doesn't handle system dependencies.
2014-06-18 12:04:35	mathuin	Compile from source and install in the right spot?
2014-06-18 12:04:43	terrellt	mathuin: Yeah. Some do that. Nokogiri for instance.
2014-06-18 12:04:52	terrellt	Unless you tell it no.
2014-06-18 12:05:23	mathuin	Keen.  I really like that feature with virtualenv.
2014-06-18 12:05:45	terrellt	It makes installing nokogiri the first time a pita, especially in places like Travis.
2014-06-18 12:05:48	terrellt	But you can tell it not to.
2014-06-18 12:06:24	mathuin	I'd rather it that way, to be honest, so I can work with multiple versions of a package.
2014-06-18 12:06:55	terrellt	Most libraries don't, instead they just let you pass arguments on where the executable is so you can deal with it.
2014-06-18 12:07:09	terrellt	Gems that use GraphicsMagick for instance.
2014-06-18 12:07:23	terrellt	As you can expect it quickly gets out of hand, though.
2014-06-18 12:08:20	terrellt	spectralsun: Woooahh. That post is WAY out of date.
2014-06-18 12:09:01	terrellt	spectralsun: Rails developers have been some of the most professional and focused on improving themselves and their architecture web developers I've ever met.
2014-06-18 12:12:26	mathuin	And the guy who wrote that post is ... not exactly someone I'd want as a character reference based on what I've read.
2014-06-18 12:13:12	mathuin	He also has an ax to grind, sine he basically blames Rails for destroying his career.
2014-06-18 12:13:19	terrellt	Indeed.
2014-06-18 12:13:22	terrellt	mathuin++
2014-06-18 12:13:30	mathuin	So yeah, not exactly a fair example.
2014-06-18 12:13:42	terrellt	The only grievance I have against the rails community is I'm not a big DHH fan, but meh.
2014-06-18 12:13:56	mathuin	My only real experience with Ruby is with Rails.  There's way too much fragile magic in there.
2014-06-18 12:14:21	mathuin	Django has been more resilient, less surprising, and more flexible than Rails, so I just stopped going there.
2014-06-18 12:14:37	terrellt	mathuin: That puts a lot of people off, yeah. They've hidden immense complexity, in my experience what really happens is there's a much bigger learning gap there than what it takes to just get a good web app off the ground.
2014-06-18 12:15:19	mathuin	And frankly it doesn't seem necessary.
2014-06-18 12:16:08	terrellt	I haven't spent enough time in Django to make an easy comparison, but I can't point to a specific thing in Rails' infrastructure I totally disagree with. Except helpers. Those were a bad idea.
2014-06-18 12:16:10	mathuin	With Django, if I don't want to do it their way, it's relatively straightforward to go around whatever is my obstacle.
2014-06-18 12:16:15	mathuin	Rails is a minefield.
2014-06-18 12:16:46	terrellt	Hm? I've gone around it plenty without any trouble.
2014-06-18 12:17:02	mathuin	But grain of salt, last experience writing Ruby code for Rails was several years ago, where I ran into an awesome decimal bug that my ISP wouldn't fix and at the time I didn't really have bundler doing what I need.
2014-06-18 12:17:57	mathuin	The big thing I coudln't work around/with was ActiveRecord.
2014-06-18 12:18:02	mathuin	That thing had tentacles. :-)
2014-06-18 12:18:52	terrellt	The problem there is it's just too easy to do what should be hard, so that it makes you look at your architecture.
2014-06-18 12:19:12	mathuin	I'm not into that kind of "help" from my framework.  YMMV.
2014-06-18 12:19:18	terrellt	Fair enough.
2014-06-18 12:19:21	terrellt	Totally optional too.
2014-06-18 12:19:44	mathuin	My recent tinkering with Go has shown me that maybe I've wanted more from my ORM than I've really needed in some cases.
2014-06-18 12:19:47	terrellt	Not many people opt out, but there are plenty of people using POROs for anything that isn't just state.
2014-06-18 12:19:56	terrellt	Er, "plain old ruby objects."
2014-06-18 12:20:28	mathuin	I got it from context. :-)
2014-06-18 12:21:14	terrellt	It's a shift happening in the last year or two, the very fact that there's an acronym for "something not dependent on rails" is indicative.
2014-06-18 12:21:44	mathuin	Also, I don't hear much about people using Ruby *except* for Rails, which makes for an imbalanced ecosystem.
2014-06-18 12:21:53	terrellt	That's not true, right?
2014-06-18 12:21:55	terrellt	Chef for instance.
2014-06-18 12:22:11	mathuin	I mean Ruby-for-Ruby's-sake.
2014-06-18 12:22:19	terrellt	Puppet, new relic, we have plenty of system scripts. Sinatra's ridiculously popular if you want to stay in the realm of web.
2014-06-18 12:22:36	mathuin	Sinatra I got a quick look at recently for fenestra.
2014-06-18 12:22:36	terrellt	#ruby has a number of developers who never touch the web.
2014-06-18 12:22:48	mathuin	Probably not quite like ##python. ;-)
2014-06-18 12:22:58	terrellt	Not much adoption in the sciences, so probably not. =)
2014-06-18 12:23:26	terrellt	Which is a good thing! There's a lot of strength in the scientific community picking a language.
2014-06-18 12:23:32	mathuin	I can't imagine how I would have written TopoMC in Ruby -- but I *can* imagine how I'd make it worth with Django, since I wrote it in Python.
2014-06-18 12:23:43	mathuin	A rewrite in Go, again, would be a different experience entirely.
2014-06-18 12:23:53	mathuin	And if they get GDAL bindings working better, I just might go there.
2014-06-18 12:24:57	terrellt	There's a gem, but I can't speak to how it is. Looks out of date.
2014-06-18 12:26:11	mathuin	The biggest problem is with GDAL, not with Ruby or Python.
2014-06-18 12:26:18	mathuin	The project developers haven't extended their API far enough.
2014-06-18 12:27:08	terrellt	Ah.
2014-06-18 12:28:15	terrellt	But yeah, if there are some specific grievances against ruby from you guys I'd like to hear them. My python's not great, but it'd be an interesting conversation.
2014-06-18 12:28:28	mathuin	Similar problems exist with projects like Minecraft, where the primary developers change so much so fast the fans get fatigue keeping up.  If you're not using Java and decompiling everything Mojang's putting out, you're working too hard.
2014-06-18 12:28:39	mathuin	*nod*  I've shared what turned me away, that's about all that I've got on the topic.

2014-06-18 12:29:07	terrellt	Can we agree down with Java, at least?
2014-06-18 12:30:07	mathuin	Write once, run nowhere?  Yeah.
2014-06-18 12:30:23	terrellt	Run nowhere, and have no ram left.
2014-06-18 12:30:47	terrellt	Damn JVM tax.
2014-06-18 13:40:49	mathuin	Go has its own RAM tax, for sure.
2014-06-18 13:42:06	mathuin	Fair tradeoff for having a single big pile of works.
2014-06-18 13:42:49	terrellt	I can't say much, I'm a ruby developer. It's practically baked in that we assume ram's cheap.
2014-06-18 13:45:40	mathuin	A little frustrating from someone whose first machine had 64K of RAM. :-)
2014-06-18 14:36:15	jnoah	you know your music is awesome if it has goat sounds
2014-06-18 14:57:28	Odysimus	mathuin: 64K, wow. My first one started with 16K then got bumped to 24 when we added the 33.6Kbps modem
2014-06-18 15:03:56	pop_n_fresh	I feel awkwardly young...
2014-06-18 15:04:17	edunham	pop_n_fresh: dont' worry about it; mock everyone else for being awkardly old.

2014-06-18 15:05:18	mathuin	We dodged the VIC-20 era and went straight to the C-64.  Stupid serial port had a max data rate of 2396 so we couldn't run 2400bps reliably. :-(
2014-06-18 15:05:27	pop_n_fresh	My first machine had 512MB...
2014-06-18 15:06:44	terrellt	I'm not sure what mine had.
2014-06-18 15:07:05	terrellt	It ran Dune I think.

2014-06-18 15:09:17	pop_n_fresh	I was rocking xp sp2. I remember upgrading to sp3 and it basically bricked it.
2014-06-18 15:10:28	pono	Apple ][c for me
2014-06-18 15:11:58	terrellt	I don't remember if our first one had 95. We had one that was 95, but it wasn't our first one.
2014-06-18 15:13:03	terrellt	I never had anything worse than a 56k modem.
2014-06-18 15:13:08	terrellt	But those sounds will forever haunt my dreams.
2014-06-18 15:14:28	 *	edunham has considered getting a real phone and setting modem sounds as the ringtone
2014-06-18 15:14:31	leel8on	Tandy 1000 connected to CompuServ
2014-06-18 15:14:36	edunham	so it'd sing the song of dialing the number who'd called
2014-06-18 15:14:42	edunham	one would learn to caller ID pretty quickly, I assume
2014-06-18 15:16:10	lrr	edunham: you mean skrillex?
2014-06-18 15:16:19	lrr	they're both the same
2014-06-18 15:17:47	edunham	lrr: no, the sounds of modems vary based on the input
2014-06-18 15:17:55	lrr	lol
2014-06-18 15:18:32	jnoah	edunham: thanks for the idea...
2014-06-18 15:19:05	lrr	the windows 98 log in sound brings back so many childhood memories
2014-06-18 15:19:10	edunham	jnoah: write an app for that :3
2014-06-18 15:19:12	mathuin	edunham: I have an Android app that does the same thing but with Morse code and contacts.
2014-06-18 15:19:32	mathuin	Not sure how to do the on-the-fly part of ringtone assignment.
2014-06-18 15:19:33	edunham	mathuin: shiney
2014-06-18 15:19:54	mathuin	You'd have to change the default ring tone every time an unknown call came in to something which was a concatenation of the relevant digits.
2014-06-18 15:20:03	mathuin	Not hard, but might take 150ms before you hear the ring.
2014-06-18 15:20:17	bkero	Could use binary morse

2014-06-18 21:15:22	mythmon	pop_n_fresh: print just writes to stdout.

2014-06-18 21:32:20	mythmon	the answer to your question is no.
2014-06-18 21:32:25	lucyw	mythmon: can i make everything strings and call it good?
2014-06-18 21:32:34	mythmon	technically every element of a list is the same thing: a reference.
2014-06-18 21:32:57	mythmon	lucyw: you can have different types in a list. [1, 'foo', {'bar': baz}] is fine.

2014-06-19 09:48:06	mathuin	So how does Chrome or Firefox know that the certificate for www.python.org is okay if it's really issued to *.c.ssl.fastly.net ?
2014-06-19 09:49:11	mathuin	I only ask because the wget that comes with Centos 6.5 insists that the cert is not acceptable while the updated wget does.
2014-06-19 09:55:46	pruittt	mathuin: Kind of newb on this side of things, but chrome/FF trust the CA higher in the chain from *.c.ssl.fastly.net... I was rather confused about this too, and found a couple things:
2014-06-19 09:56:22	pruittt	http://bit.ly/UQHlsy
2014-06-19 09:56:37	pruittt	Mentions the cert at fastly.net is a SAN for multiple hosts, including python
2014-06-19 09:56:58	terrellt	If you look at it in Chrome you can see them all.
2014-06-19 09:57:07	terrellt	As DNS names under Extension.

2014-06-20 04:22:34	chekkaa	and you can pass tee as many filenames/pipes as you want, so you can pipe data to as many things as you want
2014-06-20 04:23:17	teiresias	It's a bashism I believe.
2014-06-20 04:24:08	teiresias	So run that tee >(cat) and in another console ps -aef |grep tee, and you can see how it's implemented.
2014-06-20 04:37:13	teiresias	I'm also pretty sure it will break if the program receiving the process substitutions closes all file descriptors other than stdin/stdout/stderr that it receives from the parent.  Some programs do that for security reasons.
2014-06-20 04:52:37	teiresias	http://sprunge.us/RcSe ... and call "closer tee >(cat)", fails as expected.

2014-06-21 18:20:47	frostsnow	Weyoun: ?
2014-06-21 18:26:36	Weyoun	My server just died.
2014-06-21 18:26:42	Weyoun	Not detecting any SATA devices.
2014-06-21 18:27:53	Weyoun	frostsnow ^^
2014-06-21 18:44:10	frostsnow	Weyoun: Ah, dead dead. Condolences :(
2014-06-21 18:45:15	Weyoun	I wanted to replace it with System76’s Leopard Ex, but not this soon.
2014-06-21 18:45:25	Weyoun	Can’t afford the leox just yet.
2014-06-21 18:48:05	Weyoun	frostsnow: If I get a new motherboard these days, what are the chances I could use the processor I already have in Euclid?

2014-06-21 18:56:37	frostsnow	Weyoun: FIIK
2014-06-21 18:57:01	Weyoun	Heh
2014-06-21 18:57:16	Weyoun	Any thoughts on Gigabyte motherboards?
2014-06-21 18:58:24	frostsnow	No clue
2014-06-21 19:02:39	frostsnow	Weyoun: The minuend minus the subtrahend is the difference, right?
2014-06-21 19:05:00	Weyoun	Er, um, that is a question that is quite orthogonal to discussion on motherboards.
2014-06-21 19:17:02	frostsnow	Weyoun: Yes, but I think someone was fucking with Wikipedia and now I have the position of the subtrahend and the minuend all fuckered around in my head.
2014-06-21 19:17:13	frostsnow	Erm, subtract one piece of profanity
2014-06-21 19:17:18	frostsnow	Excess is just poor manners ;)
2014-06-21 19:21:03	Weyoun	frostsnow: the math articles on Wikipedia sometimes have a way of conveying a whole slew of useful information, followed by an information overload.
2014-06-21 19:21:20	Weyoun	Their list of trigonometric identities page, for instance.
2014-06-21 19:21:54	frostsnow	Sadly, it's not exactly the type of question that I can ask to a random street thug, and, amusingly enough, one that cannot even be asked to most engineers and people who ought to know about math, myself included.
2014-06-21 19:22:28	frostsnow	Weyoun: Yes, they do. I'd like you to directly answer my question, though, for the aforementioned reasons.
2014-06-21 19:23:08	Weyoun	Well, shoot, I have to go look it up.
2014-06-21 19:23:14	Weyoun	I mean, I use “difference”
2014-06-21 19:23:56	Weyoun	But subtrahend and minuend? I have heard them before, but I just don’t use those terms.
2014-06-21 19:25:02	frostsnow	Hah, how amusing! Yes, that's how I -usually- feel, but today I am implementing some math and need to name variables, and their technical name is the best choice in my opinion.
2014-06-21 19:25:23	frostsnow	!s/name is/names are/g
2014-06-21 19:25:24	@hamper	frostsnow actually meant: Hah, how amusing! Yes, that's how I -usually- feel, but today I am implementing some math and need to name variables, and their technical names are the best choice in my opinion.
2014-06-21 19:25:42	Weyoun	Well, aren’t there more informative names you can give them? Or are you just implementing a generic subtraction algorithm?
2014-06-21 19:28:05	frostsnow	It's a generic subtraction algorithm
2014-06-21 19:28:33	Weyoun	So in other words, you are reinventing the wheel?
2014-06-21 19:28:48	Weyoun	My living room is WAY too quiet now.
2014-06-21 19:29:10	frostsnow	Sure
2014-06-21 19:31:48	frostsnow	OKay, so I'm _pretty_ so that it's "minuend - subtrahend = difference"

I don't know the staistics of open-source vs proprietary software in research, but I would not assume that a high usage of proprietary tools means that proprietary tools are better, merely that people currently have more faith in them, whether that faith is founded or not. Work places requiring social media doesn't make social media good.
2014-06-26 23:24:36	frostsnow	RMS isn't *popular*. If you would rather be *popular* than *right*, go right ahead, but understand that you run the risk of being neither like all fools who seek fame.

The problem is that it's an invasive technology controlled by megacorps, and now that it is here, there will be more and more social pressure to use it.

2014-06-27 03:06:45	Dutchess__	they're corporations
2014-06-27 03:07:10	Dutchess__	they're not any more evil than open source groups
2014-06-27 03:07:15	Dutchess__	or small startups
2014-06-27 03:07:21	Dutchess__	they're just a company
2014-06-27 03:07:45	Dutchess__	your obsession with capitalism being somehow controlling and not moral is odd
2014-06-27 03:07:51	Dutchess__	and insane
2014-06-27 03:10:29	teiresias	It's proven itself to be pretty immoral or at least "morally flexible" time and time again, at least on the large scale.  Small scale, where people know each other, capitalism can work.
2014-06-27 03:10:50	Dutchess__	socialism doesn't work on the large scale
2014-06-27 03:10:59	Dutchess__	communism doesn't either
2014-06-27 03:11:04	Dutchess__	only capitalism does
2014-06-27 03:11:21	Dutchess__	but you need to define what morals are
2014-06-27 03:11:28	teiresias	Nothing works on the large scale, because humans aren't hard-wired for it.  We're evolved to live in tribal / village groups of about 150 people.
2014-06-27 03:12:00	Dutchess__	i'd like to see you do research for this
2014-06-27 03:12:09	Dutchess__	capitalism works better on a larger scale
2014-06-27 03:12:13	Dutchess__	than socialism or communism
2014-06-27 03:13:21	Dutchess__	it still doesn't mean corporations are evil
2014-06-27 03:18:40	teiresias	Capitalism only survives because socialism is always willing to help it out of a bind.  Witness the 2008 bank bailout.  For that matter, how about FDR and the New Deal?  This country would have gone Communist if it hadn't been for FDR, even though the capitalists revile him.
2014-06-27 03:20:16	Dutchess__	everything will fail after time
2014-06-27 03:20:28	Dutchess__	like in the cold war
2014-06-27 03:20:44	Dutchess__	however Capitalism generally is better
2014-06-27 03:20:59	teiresias	Sure it will, at scale!  Small-scale sustainable societies don't fail.
2014-06-27 03:21:05	Dutchess__	well
2014-06-27 03:21:13	Dutchess__	you can go find a small island

2014-06-27 03:25:16	Dutchess__	but it's like not owning a phone when you travel

2014-06-30 10:26:09	lrr	and reverse dns for his ipv6 address as well
2014-06-30 10:28:02	Mathuin	AWS asks you to contact them to open a case when your MFA fails.  The only way to log into that case is with your MFA.  Hate.
2014-06-30 10:28:14	akeym	...i have ipv6 at my house?
2014-06-30 10:28:24	Mathuin	I have Comcast, I do not think I have IPv6 at home.
2014-06-30 10:28:28	Mathuin	Now I'm wondering.
2014-06-30 10:29:47	akeym	if you have a home router, then it needs to suport ipv6.  if you want your clients on your home network to get ipv6 connectivity, it also needs to be able to handle prefix delegation properly
2014-06-30 10:30:16	lrr	^^
2014-06-30 10:30:21	Mathuin	I'm on step 1 first.
2014-06-30 10:30:53	akeym	...oh, and I guess the modem needs to support it as well
2014-06-30 10:31:00	lrr	^^
2014-06-30 10:31:30	lrr	my nas ends up collecting about 4-6 ipv6 addresses on its eth0
2014-06-30 10:31:33	Mathuin	It's only reporting an IPv4 address on the status page.
2014-06-30 10:31:34	lrr	it's weird
2014-06-30 10:31:43	lrr	Mathuin: what modem?
2014-06-30 10:32:21	lrr	lol, my nas' eth0 has 8 ipv6 addresses associated to it
2014-06-30 10:32:31	lrr	yay for SLAAC

2014-06-30 10:33:01	Mathuin	lrr: it's made by Zoom, I don't remember the model number.  5350 rings a bell, but there's nothing obvious to tell me.
2014-06-30 10:34:05	spectralsun	does the rdio app work on linux desktop? specifically arch?
2014-06-30 10:34:11	spectralsun	I think you need adobe AIR?
2014-06-30 10:34:26	lrr	Mathuin: the model number you gave me says it supports ipv6 http://www.zoomtel.com/products/5350.html
2014-06-30 10:34:28	jnoah	there's a desktop app for rdio?
2014-06-30 10:34:29	akeym	the modem probably wouldn't tell you much, my motorola doesn't bother mentioning ipv6 addresses even though it supports it
2014-06-30 10:34:35	lrr	BUT i don't know if that's enabled for you

2014-06-30 10:35:14	Mathuin	Yeah, Zoom 5350.  The specs page says "Network addressing: IPv4 and IPv6" but that's simple and incomplete.

2014-06-30 16:10:07	edunham	Python has `a = foo if condition else bar`. Closest I can find in Ruby is `a = if condition then foo else bar end`. Am I missing something?
2014-06-30 16:12:31	pingveno	yuck
2014-06-30 16:12:39	pingveno	I always hated Python's syntax for that
2014-06-30 16:13:12	pingveno	I remember seeing that in Ruby code a few times, so presumably it's idiomatic
2014-06-30 16:14:59	edunham	yeah serves me right for getting used to the python syntax
2014-06-30 16:18:47	jnoah	edunham: it's known as the ternary operator
2014-06-30 16:18:53	jnoah	ruby uses the same as C
2014-06-30 16:19:19	jnoah	or rather, can do it the way you have or you can do it C style
2014-06-30 16:19:29	edunham	yeah turns out ternary's the best fit
2014-06-30 16:20:29	edunham	had to go test stuff to figure out that you can actually assign into a var with ternary's output without problems
2014-06-30 16:23:49	pingveno	I'm starting to become fond of expression-based languages after working with Rust quite a bit
2014-06-30 16:24:26	pingveno	Where most things in the language are expressions (e.g. if foo { ... } else { ... })
2014-06-30 16:34:19	jnoah	edunham: ternary is pretty great :)
2014-06-30 16:35:37	edunham	yes, i've known about ternary since high school. i'm gonna blame this one on the python brain rot of ceasing to expect that anything c-flavored will ever work right.
2014-06-30 16:36:06	jnoah	heh, yeah. I miss it in python :/
2014-06-30 16:36:14	edunham	same with switch-case

2014-06-30 20:51:11	deanj	muricula: For the iphone 3g, I think there's a website you can go to on the phone that does it for you.
2014-06-30 20:51:27	muricula	I'm looking at a 3gs
2014-06-30 20:51:36	muricula	also, that got patched a long time ago
2014-06-30 20:52:04	deanj	Not if your firmware wasn't updated.
2014-06-30 20:52:13	deanj	3gs is old, try this site: http://www.jailbreakme.com/#
2014-06-30 20:52:35	deanj	I had a 3G s like 2 years ago and jailbroke it with that site.
2014-06-30 21:04:45	chance	if it isnt updated to make that not work, then your phone has some serious vulnerabilities

2014-07-01 08:36:42	Mathuin	On the bright side, it totally screws the folks who collect those coverless "allegedly destroyed" books, and I'm okay with that.
2014-07-01 08:37:29	jnoah	lol, what do you have against that?
2014-07-01 08:38:16	Mathuin	the covers are torn off to prove that the books weren't sold.  the publisher gets zero cash for those.  possession of those is effectively stealing from the publisher.
2014-07-01 08:38:26	Mathuin	it's rational that owners of those books do not get the other benefits of book ownership.
2014-07-01 08:38:34	Mathuin	... I have tons of them, mind you.
2014-07-01 08:38:36	Mathuin	Just saying.

2014-07-01 09:36:56	Mathuin	http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/27/google-women-techmakers-code-school-program/ -- from our alum Greg Lund-Chaix on G+.  Code School vouchers for female I/O attendees and others "inside the tech community" with a link to submitting yourself.  Interesting (and sad) to note that "Comments on this post have been turned off due to a lack of civil discourse."
2014-07-01 09:37:18	jnoah	Mathuin: do you end up getting and reading a lot of those?
2014-07-01 09:37:40	jnoah	if so, are they pretty good?
2014-07-01 09:39:13	Mathuin	I have not purchased a single one.  In general, though, those books are really good.
2014-07-01 09:39:38	Mathuin	When I was a contractor there, I could borrow books for free.

2014-07-01 09:42:59	lucyw	in Haskell?
2014-07-01 09:44:03	pono	I was just futzing with Haskell, but it would be a neet project to implement dimensional analysis as a type system.

2014-07-01 09:47:28	pono	They've got a 'perfect sphere' that is ~1kg
2014-07-01 09:47:34	pono	But it's been losing mass mysteriously
2014-07-01 09:47:40	pono	So, not a very good standard
2014-07-01 09:47:41	Mathuin	No, not water, it's iridium platinum for the current one and silicon for the sphere.
2014-07-01 09:47:47	shirgan	I heard about that on one of the podcasts I listen to.
2014-07-01 09:47:48	mythmon	new proposed definition: The kilogram, kg, is the unit of mass; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the Planck constant to be equal to exactly 6.62606X×10−34 when it is expressed in the unit s−1·m2·kg, which is equal to J·s.
2014-07-01 09:47:51	jnoah	edunham: heh true, though iirc it was some metal, but not sure which
2014-07-01 09:47:56	shirgan	Radiolab? I feel like it was Radiolab.

2014-07-01 15:03:13	Mathuin	terrellt: the survey response may improve even more if it goes away for 3-6 months after you answer the survey.
2014-07-01 15:03:42	Mathuin	I understand that's not doable really with anonymous users, but for those of us who are logged in (and WTF is up with logging in and osulibrary.o.e is another story) it would be nice.

2014-07-01 15:07:03	terrellt	Mathuin: What do you mean regarding the second bit?
2014-07-01 15:07:10	terrellt	The logging in.
2014-07-01 15:32:03	Mathuin	With most other oregonstate.edu sites (think Drupal or online services here) there is an explicit place to log in.
2014-07-01 15:32:25	Mathuin	When I go to the library site, there's no way to log in unless you're doing a search from offcampus AFAIK.
2014-07-01 15:32:38	terrellt	What functionality are you expecting to get from logging in?
2014-07-01 15:32:46	Mathuin	"My Account".
2014-07-01 15:33:13	Mathuin	While I recognize that library accounts are different than ONID accounts, it's sorta confusing.
2014-07-01 15:33:49	Mathuin	You are forced to log in if you want to reserve a study room, for instance.
2014-07-01 15:34:02	Mathuin	And the ILL login is completely different.
2014-07-01 15:34:12	Mathuin	(UI, not authentication credentials)
2014-07-01 15:35:33	terrellt	Right, unfortunately there's not much I can do about ILL.
2014-07-01 15:36:27	Mathuin	Like I said, I get that things need to be wacky since the library serves ONID and non-ONID users alike, it's just ... inconsistent.
2014-07-01 15:37:07	Mathuin	Best thing to do with ILL is put it behind the ONID login like study rooms -- if only ONID folks are allowed to ILL.  If non-ONID folks are allowed to ILL, then you can't.  Can non-ONID folks reserve study rooms?  I guess not.
2014-07-01 15:37:24	Mathuin	Anyway, this isn't a Valley Library focus group.  Sorry for filling the channel. :-)
2014-07-01 15:37:32	terrellt	Lol
2014-07-01 15:37:58	terrellt	The ONID login for ILL isn't actually an ONID login. It's not making LDAP queries or using CAS.
2014-07-01 15:38:25	jnoah	ILL?
2014-07-01 15:38:29	terrellt	Interlibrary Loan
2014-07-01 15:38:57	Mathuin	In my hometown, the ILL folks got to know me real well. :-)
2014-07-01 15:39:10	Mathuin	And it's one of the wife's favorite jobs in the library industry.
2014-07-01 15:40:36	terrellt	On a side note, the study room's the way it should be everywhere. If you're logged into CAS from any OSU system it'll pull it automatically and you'll just be logged into study rooms.
2014-07-01 15:40:49	terrellt	CAS gatewaying ftw.
2014-07-01 15:41:01	Mathuin	SSO that's actually SSO is good.
2014-07-01 15:41:01	pingveno	I do love me some CAS
2014-07-01 15:41:22	pingveno	So easy to program against
2014-07-01 15:41:59	Mathuin	I just wish they'd make Drupal do the 'social media' thing instead of only letting authors and administrators do things.
2014-07-01 15:42:28	terrellt	Relatively. The Ruby library needed some help to do saml extra attributes.
2014-07-01 15:42:28	Mathuin	I need to complain again at the Drupal community meeting. :-)
2014-07-01 16:10:01	pwnguin	'social media' thing?
2014-07-01 16:10:14	pwnguin	The University Homepage Anyone Can Edit
2014-07-01 16:11:34	Mathuin	No, more like "allow organization members to post images and text in a facebook/instragram/tumblr/etc manner on Drupal sites using their ONIDs for authentication".
2014-07-01 16:12:03	Mathuin	They need an extra class -- "member" -- with minimal privileges, etc.
2014-07-01 16:12:15	pingveno	Bad security = the web site anyone can edit?

2014-07-01 16:41:20	Mathuin	If I could configure the Drupal site to track hashtags on G+, we could fake it with the school-issued Google accounts.

2014-07-01 21:29:38	ekemsend	corvallis city council is largely mormon from my understanding
2014-07-01 21:29:46	ekemsend	ever notice how there isnt a single strip joint?
2014-07-01 21:29:49	ekemsend	male or female

2014-07-01 21:30:17	pwnguin	i hadnt really gone looking for one
2014-07-01 21:30:45	pwnguin	and coming from kansas, it seems normal to me to ban strip clubs inside city limits

2014-07-01 21:31:27	pwnguin	anyways, there's far too many coffee houses to call this place mormon
2014-07-01 21:31:48	ekemsend	haha thats an acceptable drug per lassez faire markets
2014-07-01 21:31:56	ekemsend	but only local coffee shops
2014-07-01 21:32:39	ekemsend	the only place strip clubs make economic sense is in a dense urban area with strong mate competition
2014-07-01 21:32:47	ekemsend	college towns are desireable
2014-07-01 21:32:57	ekemsend	so corvallis is pretty strong on keeping the status quo here

2014-07-01 21:42:24	ekemsend	the inclusion of a social construct on a network like the internet is pointless

2014-07-01 21:44:47	ekemsend	a server might cost x dollars
2014-07-01 21:44:59	ekemsend	but a server with a social value might cost x+y dollars
2014-07-01 21:45:12	ekemsend	where y is only present because a company advertises

2014-07-01 22:16:40	ekemsend	so do you regex the tail output for your name?
2014-07-01 22:17:05	ekemsend	i use the list plugin and it highlights the channel with a color when your name has been sent
2014-07-01 22:17:19	ekemsend	so thats a solution, but it doesnt notify you any other way
2014-07-01 22:18:25	pono	I use irssi, and grep.  It's not very elegant.

2014-07-01 23:04:07	Orcbane	Has a pretty bad rating on rotten tomatoes.  I've recently seen Days of Future Past and Hotel Budapest.
2014-07-01 23:04:29	ekemsend	i tried budapest
2014-07-01 23:04:33	Orcbane	Hotel Budapest was hilarious, Days of Future Past was so-so.
2014-07-01 23:04:35	ekemsend	more trash from whats his face
2014-07-01 23:04:56	Orcbane	I have to say, I'm fond of Wes Anderson myself.
2014-07-01 23:04:57	ekemsend	see i just thought he hit his mark with like rushmore
2014-07-01 23:05:27	Orcbane	I haven't actually seen that one.
2014-07-01 23:05:30	ekemsend	now its just getting pretentious, i wore 3 or 4 pairs of hipster glasses and just couldnt get into budapest
2014-07-01 23:05:48	ekemsend	yeah its good, same with tanenbaums or the aquatic one
2014-07-01 23:06:15	Orcbane	I've watched the Aquatic Life with Steve Zissou.
2014-07-01 23:06:23	ekemsend	yea that one
2014-07-01 23:06:25	Orcbane	I enjoyed that one as well.
2014-07-01 23:06:40	ekemsend	i feel like anderson just smokes hash all day and then writes film scripts
2014-07-01 23:06:46	ekemsend	anyone buys his shit now i think
2014-07-01 23:07:04	Orcbane	I also thought he did pretty well on Fantastic Mr.Fox.
2014-07-01 23:07:18	ekemsend	havent seen that one yet
2014-07-01 23:07:48	Orcbane	It's pretty funny I think.  But then again, I've liked all his stuff so far.
2014-07-01 23:08:01	Orcbane	At least that I've seen.
2014-07-01 23:08:27	ekemsend	its a little to tempered of a surrealist take on film making
2014-07-01 23:08:43	ekemsend	like jodoworksy would be an example of over the top surrealism
2014-07-01 23:08:51	ekemsend	anderson feels like pandering a lot of times
2014-07-01 23:09:10	ekemsend	kind of like terentino openly admits he does what he does because he thinks its cool
2014-07-01 23:09:16	ekemsend	and happily rips off other films
2014-07-01 23:11:06	Orcbane	Never seen any of Jodorowsky's stuff, I have Dune on VHS though.  Just never watched it.
2014-07-01 23:11:17	ekemsend	dune is lynch

2014-07-01 23:13:48	Orcbane	I've been afraid of reading the other ones written by his son.
2014-07-01 23:14:06	ekemsend	haha
2014-07-01 23:14:23	ekemsend	well check out the comics moerpheus and jodoworsky did

2014-07-01 23:27:54	Orcbane	Heh, never read the Time Machine.  I did read The Island of Dr.Moreau, however.

2014-07-01 23:28:24	ekemsend	hg wells isnt bad, but i cant read sci fi, only audiobooks
2014-07-01 23:28:34	ekemsend	i tried tale of two cities one time
2014-07-01 23:28:37	ekemsend	just never again
2014-07-01 23:28:50	Orcbane	Really?  Sci-fi is the main thing I read.  I also read bits of Fantasy.
2014-07-01 23:28:53	ekemsend	so if its sci fi it goes on audio book
2014-07-01 23:29:13	ekemsend	yeah i have a hard time paritioning waking hours to reading sci fi
2014-07-01 23:30:05	ekemsend	hey its the only way i could finish every novel ever written by pkd
2014-07-01 23:30:10	ekemsend	i dont thik i would have read them in book form
2014-07-01 23:30:20	ekemsend	so im glad audiobooks exist to be honest
2014-07-01 23:30:28	Orcbane	PKD is an amazing sci-fi writer as well.
2014-07-01 23:30:44	ekemsend	yes, although i look at his work as more of like what a seer does
2014-07-01 23:30:53	ekemsend	man was half out his gourd when writing that stuff
2014-07-01 23:31:11	Orcbane	I could see that.  Really good writing though.
2014-07-01 23:31:23	ekemsend	yeah at the end of his life he was full blown schizo
2014-07-01 23:31:37	ekemsend	well in a western model he was
2014-07-01 23:31:42	ekemsend	he was sure he was having visions
2014-07-01 23:31:48	ekemsend	but he was a hell of a meth user
2014-07-01 23:32:12	Orcbane	Yeah, that could mess up the brain a little bit.
2014-07-01 23:32:14	ekemsend	hes like ken kesey
2014-07-01 23:32:16	Orcbane	Just a tad.
2014-07-01 23:32:17	ekemsend	except off the rails
2014-07-01 23:32:34	ekemsend	well from what i understand government meth was what was aroudn in the 60s
2014-07-01 23:32:37	ekemsend	and it was a lot cleaner
2014-07-01 23:32:52	ekemsend	before bikers got involved
2014-07-01 23:33:26	ekemsend	but if you read valis
2014-07-01 23:33:36	ekemsend	thats when pkd is expressing his blurred reality completely
2014-07-01 23:33:50	Orcbane	Oh!  That might be interesting to read.
2014-07-01 23:34:08	ekemsend	from the wk synopsis
2014-07-01 23:34:10	ekemsend	Horselover Fat believes his visions expose hidden facts about the reality of life on Earth, and a group of others join him in researching these matters. One of their theories is that there is some kind of alien space probe in orbit around Earth, and that it is aiding them in their quest. It also aided the United States in disclosing the Watergate scandal and the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974.
2014-07-01 23:34:19	ekemsend	horselover fat is pkd
2014-07-01 23:34:26	ekemsend	he was so poor he was eating horse at one point
2014-07-01 23:35:00	ekemsend	also from wiki
2014-07-01 23:35:01	ekemsend	Dick also offers a rationalist explanation of his apparent "theophany", acknowledging that it might have been visual and auditory hallucinations from either schizophrenia or drug addiction sequelae.[1]
2014-07-01 23:35:33	Orcbane	That's pretty intense.
2014-07-01 23:35:36	ekemsend	pkd is quoted as saying the only reason he exists in a literary way
2014-07-01 23:35:39	ekemsend	is because his bitch wife
2014-07-01 23:35:50	ekemsend	he got methed up and wrote because he wife
2014-07-01 23:35:58	ekemsend	which when pkd his wife got all the rights
2014-07-01 23:36:07	ekemsend	notice how many SHIT movies have been made from pkd stories?

2014-07-01 23:44:40	mythmon	Orcbane: no worries. i'm actually probably just being a little grumpt.
2014-07-01 23:44:53	ekemsend	i think mythmon was implying the channel has so much normal good content
2014-07-01 23:44:57	mythmon	s/grumpt/grumpy/
2014-07-01 23:44:57	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: Orcbane: no worries. i'm actually probably just being a little grumpy.
2014-07-01 23:45:02	ekemsend	that nic cage just hampers the logs
2014-07-01 23:45:31	ekemsend	i cant tell if this channel is for the osu labs or what
2014-07-01 23:45:34	ekemsend	if it is
2014-07-01 23:45:36	ekemsend	no more MS
2014-07-01 23:45:44	mythmon	it's for the OSU LUG
2014-07-01 23:45:49	mythmon	LUG is Linux User Group
2014-07-01 23:46:07	mythmon	it's a campus club focused on education and outreach for open source software.
2014-07-01 23:46:17	mythmon	since it's summer, it's a little quiet round here.
2014-07-01 23:46:28	ekemsend	hehe did the campus just ok tuition to go to ms office?
2014-07-01 23:46:32	ekemsend	is that what i heard
2014-07-01 23:46:52	ekemsend	like every student now gets a license to ms? does osu get cash monies from ms or what
2014-07-01 23:47:01	Orcbane	mythmon: Sorry to hear it.  I'm a little grumpy myself, dealing with this email I got from a scholarship application and there are requirements I have no way of filling.
2014-07-01 23:47:19	ekemsend	Orcbane: just find the part of you that is 1/16 navajo
2014-07-01 23:47:23	mythmon	ekemsend: i don't follow osu happenings much lately.
2014-07-01 23:47:24	ekemsend	theyll pay you to enroll
2014-07-01 23:47:37	ekemsend	even if you like to huff dat gas
2014-07-01 23:48:29	Orcbane	Heh, nah.  They want me to take this transfer orientation class in the fall that goes from 5:00PM - 7:00PM on four Thursdays during term.
2014-07-01 23:48:49	ekemsend	navajos dont have to go i hear
2014-07-01 23:49:04	Orcbane	The problem is, I have Physics Lab on Thursdays, from  2:30 to 5:20PM.
2014-07-01 23:49:08	ekemsend	osu has a lot of hoops to jump through dude
2014-07-01 23:49:11	ekemsend	talk to an advisor
2014-07-01 23:49:11	Orcbane	And I live in Salem.
2014-07-01 23:49:23	ekemsend	ive taken 2 courses that i took in middle school after transfering
2014-07-01 23:49:29	ekemsend	mainly dat fuckin health class
2014-07-01 23:49:44	ekemsend	so there is more bullshit to come
2014-07-01 23:50:01	Orcbane	It's only for this specific Scholarship.
2014-07-01 23:50:17	ekemsend	well i hope it works out
2014-07-01 23:50:27	ekemsend	probably worth the bump in cash flow
2014-07-01 23:50:40	Orcbane	Thanks man.  I do appreciate it.  It's just obnoxious is all.
2014-07-01 23:50:49	ekemsend	yep, advisors understand that
2014-07-01 23:50:52	ekemsend	they might work with you
2014-07-01 23:51:15	ekemsend	tell them on the reservation you dont have to put up with this white man bullshit
2014-07-01 23:51:22	ekemsend	and ask them to check their white college privilege
2014-07-01 23:51:40	ekemsend	they will make you a professor
2014-07-01 23:58:05	Orcbane	Well, I sent the scholarship director an email.
2014-07-01 23:58:14	Orcbane	Hopefully that works out well enough.
2014-07-01 23:58:41	ekemsend	well ill go in your place for a fee
2014-07-01 23:58:59	Orcbane	Nah, that would take the fun out of it.
2014-07-01 23:59:11	ekemsend	oh is this one of those beer classes
2014-07-01 23:59:15	ekemsend	where you drink beer
2014-07-01 23:59:28	ekemsend	i hope it works out
2014-07-01 23:59:37	ekemsend	the bills for tuition are always going up
2014-07-01 23:59:52	Orcbane	That's definitely true.
2014-07-01 23:59:58	ekemsend	and the education level seems to be ever decreasing
2014-07-02 00:00:01	ekemsend	needs more google
2014-07-02 00:00:05	ekemsend	needs more bulletin board
2014-07-02 00:00:12	Orcbane	Luckily, my father works there, and I get a discount.
2014-07-02 00:00:16	ekemsend	nice
2014-07-02 00:00:58	ekemsend	i just came in here to troll on of my professors
2014-07-02 00:01:02	ekemsend	his nick is not obvious though
2014-07-02 00:01:28	Orcbane	One of my professors next term is a troll.
2014-07-02 00:01:35	Orcbane	Pretty fun guy all around.
2014-07-02 00:02:00	ekemsend	is it mcgrath
2014-07-02 00:02:08	Orcbane	Nah.
2014-07-02 00:02:15	ekemsend	are you mcgrath.
2014-07-02 00:02:20	Orcbane	Nope.
2014-07-02 00:02:23	ekemsend	haha ok
2014-07-02 00:03:01	Orcbane	Just a transfer student.
2014-07-02 00:03:05	ekemsend	rare that anyone uses irc anymore, so i was excited
2014-07-02 00:03:13	ekemsend	so many irc users at osu
2014-07-02 00:03:26	Orcbane	That's true.  Also a good amount at PSU.
2014-07-02 00:03:43	ekemsend	wierd
2014-07-02 00:04:22	Orcbane	They have the CAT network.  Have a little trivia bot channel that I used to hang out at.
2014-07-02 00:04:36	ekemsend	i took some classes in comp sci at u of o years back
2014-07-02 00:04:37	ekemsend	what a joke
2014-07-02 00:04:43	ekemsend	so osu is nice
2014-07-02 00:05:15	Orcbane	OSU seems like a pretty cool place.  I've only been there once or twice, though.
2014-07-02 00:05:26	ekemsend	if you can handle a town dedicated to white people
2014-07-02 00:05:33	ekemsend	and not checking privilege
2014-07-02 00:05:36	ekemsend	this is the place
2014-07-02 00:05:45	ekemsend	but its pretty decent overall
2014-07-02 00:06:04	ekemsend	no good resteraunts or bars, maybe suds and suds
2014-07-02 00:06:18	ekemsend	but great college city, no stress, at the computing department is well funded
2014-07-02 00:06:52	Orcbane	That's pretty good.  My major is actually in the science department.
2014-07-02 00:07:01	ekemsend	best place to be
2014-07-02 00:07:05	Orcbane	Which I am pretty sure is also well-funded.
2014-07-02 00:07:17	ekemsend	yeah i was in the engineering department the other day
2014-07-02 00:07:21	ekemsend	straight pimping
2014-07-02 00:07:27	ekemsend	not sure where osu makes grant money
2014-07-02 00:07:40	ekemsend	lived in fairbanks a while and they had a huge mining department
2014-07-02 00:07:54	ekemsend	well funded from oil companies, so again cant say where osu gets its cash
2014-07-02 00:08:05	ekemsend	u of o is nike in psych research for military
2014-07-02 00:08:09	ekemsend	brain mapping etc
2014-07-02 00:08:27	ekemsend	and*
2014-07-02 00:09:35	Orcbane	Well, I've heard good things about OSU's Engineering, Agricultural, and Forestry departments.
2014-07-02 00:11:06	Orcbane	Either way, I should probably go for now.  Have a good one, everyone!

2014-07-02 08:18:35	edunham	today's vim trick: did you know that '. jumps to the last edited line, and `. jumps to the exact position of your most recent edit in this session of editing the file?
2014-07-02 08:24:17	pruittt	0.0 What kind of black magic is this?!
2014-07-02 08:24:53	pruittt	Although I say that about most vim things... still figuring out how a real text editor works =P
2014-07-02 08:25:19	edunham	pruittt: been through vimtutor yet?
2014-07-02 08:25:23	terrellt	vim++
2014-07-02 08:25:32	edunham	just invoke vimtutor... it'll take maybe half an hour, an hour
2014-07-02 08:25:47	terrellt	Highly recommend stealing some open source vim configs, gets you spun up much faster.
2014-07-02 08:25:49	edunham	all it'll really do is reassure you that the people who're scary at vim definitely did not learn it from the built-in tutorial :P
2014-07-02 08:26:16	pruittt	Haha, I havent had a chance yet. I'll have to check that out!
2014-07-02 08:26:20	edunham	terrellt: I disagree -- for developers that's fine, but for ops you want to get good at an editor that's as close to vanilla as you can
2014-07-02 08:26:58	terrellt	edunham: Before I comment, what's your reasoning?
2014-07-02 08:27:21	edunham	terrellt: in the OSL's situation, we have to manage a lot of disparate setups
2014-07-02 08:27:54	edunham	the more dependent you get on specific custom configurations on your local machine, the more foreign the editor will seem on a host with only a vanilla vim install
2014-07-02 08:28:42	edunham	I think it's a more efficient use of time and learning for ops folk to pick up the parts that will be useful to them everywhere
2014-07-02 08:29:01	edunham	however, reading through others' opensource vimrc's can be a great way to learn what's available
2014-07-02 08:29:34	edunham	and my logic applies much more to ops than to developers, who *should* have their setup customized however they want since it only occurrs in one or two places
2014-07-02 08:29:46	terrellt	edunham: Two points - I don't think you should handicap yourself to improve familiarity in external environments, the basics of vim won't change (well, theoretically.) Second, in some environments it makes sense to at least become familiar with the basics first I suppose - in our case our setups have shared user profiles.
2014-07-02 08:30:05	jnoah	edunham: do you vim without syntax highlighting?
2014-07-02 08:30:23	jnoah	it's default with all of our centos servers (as root) iirc
2014-07-02 08:31:18	edunham	jnoah: I can when i need to but vanilla vim on most distros ships with pretty decent highlighting
2014-07-02 08:31:22	 *	edunham shrugs
2014-07-02 08:31:44	edunham	terrellt: I guess I read your remark as recommending that someone just grabs a config from somewhere and drops it in without examining it
2014-07-02 08:32:15	terrellt	Should at least understand what it's changing, which can happen without knowing the extent of vim. In my opinion at least. =)
2014-07-02 08:32:25	edunham	yeah, there's the difference :)
2014-07-02 08:32:48	edunham	I think if someone wants to go skim the whole thing and pick the parts they think will be useful it's a great way to explore the editor
2014-07-02 08:33:46	edunham	but i'm cynical and think it's much more likely that an average newbie would instead just drop the files untouched into their .vim and then get confused over which features are real vim, which are their customizations, and which things would work in vanilla vim but don't because of the configs
2014-07-02 08:34:36	terrellt	All the configs I use change from vanilla-vim is it turns off arrow keys. There's a fun comment in there, " Get off my lawn
2014-07-02 08:34:44	pruittt	Sounds like a bad newbie to me...
2014-07-02 08:35:07	edunham	pruittt: go TA for the cs16x series for a term or two...
2014-07-02 08:35:15	terrellt	edunham: =(
2014-07-02 08:35:16	pruittt	... touche
2014-07-02 08:35:26	pruittt	I've met incoming CS students. I'm good.
2014-07-02 08:36:12	terrellt	Sometimes I like meeting new CS students, especially those without a lot of experience but you can tell they're going to be just fantastic.
2014-07-02 08:36:58	terrellt	(slow tests)--
2014-07-02 08:37:41	pruittt	Oh, I don't mind the experience level at all. Its more the 'I run a Counter Strike server, therefore I'm a haXXor' kids that bug me
2014-07-02 08:37:54	pruittt	I'm still too newbie to be stuck in this CLI environment >.<
2014-07-02 08:38:32	edunham	pruittt: nah CLI is how you learn
2014-07-02 08:38:37	terrellt	I seriously considered dropping my student workers into a terminal and telling them that's all they get until they're done training.
2014-07-02 08:38:41	edunham	year or two from now you'll wonder how anybody ever got anything done in a GUI
2014-07-02 08:38:49	terrellt	I decided I didn't want that review though.
2014-07-02 08:38:53	edunham	terrellt: just give 'em a box with no window manager
2014-07-02 08:39:28	edunham	have a box with a browser at the other end of the room where they can stackoverflow stuff
2014-07-02 08:39:41	pruittt	edunham: I think the only GUI I've seen in the last month is Firefox lol
2014-07-02 08:39:46	terrellt	Like I said, considered it.
2014-07-02 08:39:51	edunham	pruittt: yeah one thing about the osl is it's pretty much guaranteed to skew your perceptions of your own competence
2014-07-02 08:40:20	terrellt	I figured I was more concerned with them learning the techniques and languages before tmux, vim, unix commands, etc
2014-07-02 08:40:27	pruittt	Well, I mean, learning /usr/ didn't get that name from 'user' really hits ya =P
2014-07-02 08:40:33	edunham	with only the users to remind you that the outside world exists, there's a bias toward assuming your coworkers are an accurate representation of CSfolk...
2014-07-02 08:40:51	terrellt	^ should be.
2014-07-02 08:42:50	edunham	I wish... but no.
2014-07-02 08:43:10	terrellt	Just got through a round of interviews for a staff position. Truth.
2014-07-02 08:43:44	edunham	yeeeeah
2014-07-02 08:46:09	terrellt	Got a minion starting back up next week who wants to learn vim. Should be fun.
2014-07-02 08:46:28	edunham	:D good times
2014-07-02 08:46:38	edunham	explain modes super clearly, then uninstall all other editors
2014-07-02 08:47:10	terrellt	At least I'll be able to help her without feeling handicapped - I keep trying to use tmux bindings on the other students' to scroll up and failing miserably.
2014-07-02 08:47:43	edunham	to this day i'm still grateful to uberj and simpson and ngoke for shaming me out of using pycharm when i started at the osl and making me learn vim/screen/irssi :)
2014-07-02 08:49:15	terrellt	The internet shamed me into it.
2014-07-02 08:49:44	terrellt	Plus I couldn't find an IDE that did everything I wanted.
2014-07-02 08:49:48	edunham	yeah i would've just sneakily used pycharm because peter told me to and been embarrassed and tried to hide it from the internet, if people sitting next to me hadn't been like "this is an intervention"
2014-07-02 08:49:56	edunham	i didn't even know what i wanted 'cause i was such a newbie :)
2014-07-02 08:50:00	terrellt	Lol.
2014-07-02 08:50:08	jnoah	how's your vimgolf scores' looking these days?
2014-07-02 08:50:23	edunham	jnoah: haha yeah because i've been playing so much vimgolf in my *copious free time*
2014-07-02 08:51:27	jnoah	bake cookies <-> vimgolf, it is a tradeoff :P
2014-07-02 08:52:12	terrellt	cupcakes > cookies
2014-07-02 08:52:36	jnoah	edunham's cookies > most
2014-07-02 08:53:38	edunham	jnoah: dude i've only made cookies like twice this summer.
2014-07-02 08:53:41	terrellt	http://www.jasonandshawnda.com/foodiebride/archives/1088/ Best dairy free strawberry cupcakes ever. I've never had a response to something I've baked like this.
2014-07-02 08:54:15	terrellt	(Well, dairy free if you replace milk appropriately, I've been doing it so long I just read things that way now.)
2014-07-02 08:54:47	jnoah	edunham: i figured as much, no need to take offense
2014-07-02 08:57:15	edunham	not offended
2014-07-02 08:58:27	jnoah	:)
2014-07-02 09:05:26	jnoah	hmm, wish I would have known about vimtutor when I got started. That is a wonderful tool
2014-07-02 09:05:41	jnoah	edunham: what's the difference between 2dw and d2w?
2014-07-02 09:06:07	jnoah	or <number><action><movement> vs <action><number><movement>
2014-07-02 09:06:34	MaraJade	Wait, what does /usr/ mean if it isn't user?
2014-07-02 09:07:09	jnoah	MaraJade: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html
2014-07-02 09:07:13	edunham	jnoah: I have no idea! Any vim experts around?
2014-07-02 09:08:16	jnoah	MaraJade: oops, I don't think that link actually helped
2014-07-02 09:08:22	jnoah	the answer is: Unix System Resources
2014-07-02 09:08:43	pruittt	^ that
2014-07-02 09:08:46	MaraJade	jnoah: Yea, the link says it's user program related things
2014-07-02 09:09:13	pruittt	Makes perfect sense if you take a moment to think about users hiding in /home/. I just never questioned why it'd be in two spots, I guess, lol
2014-07-02 09:09:20	jnoah	edunham: I've always done #/act/move, but the vimtutor explained it as act/#/move. TIL
2014-07-02 09:09:37	pono	jnoah: Doesn't it just mean 'twice delete a word' and 'delete 2 words'?
2014-07-02 09:09:44	pono	Should be the same thing

2014-07-02 09:15:38	jnoah	simpson: Hey! Welcome back
2014-07-02 09:15:58	mythmon	jnoah: there is a difference.
2014-07-02 09:16:13	mythmon	oh wait, nevermind.
2014-07-02 09:16:43	mythmon	i was expecting 2dw to only keep the second word on the clipboard.
2014-07-02 09:16:48	jnoah	simpson: the question is, what's the difference between action/number/movement and number/action/movement
2014-07-02 09:17:00	simpson	Ah, for 2dw and d2w ?
2014-07-02 09:17:07	mythmon	yeah
2014-07-02 09:17:41	 *	mythmon can't think of a difference.
2014-07-02 09:19:27	terrellt	I didn't even know number/action/movement worked.
2014-07-02 09:20:11	mythmon	sure. "twice, delete a word"
2014-07-02 09:20:15	simpson	Well, 2dw multiplies the action, and d2w multiplies the movement.
2014-07-02 09:20:28	mythmon	sure. but i think they have the same net effect in everyway.
2014-07-02 09:20:46	simpson	There might be differences occasionally in the motion, if the motion is strangely dependent on position *and* you're inserting or deleting.
2014-07-02 09:21:36	simpson	For example, 2P and PP have slightly different behaviors.
2014-07-02 09:22:15	mythmon	do they?
2014-07-02 09:22:57	simpson	Yeah. Grab a word or two, and try pasting them into the middle of a line with those commands.
2014-07-02 09:23:02	mythmon	2p and pp have different behaviors, but I don't think 2P and PP do.
2014-07-02 09:23:38	mythmon	ah. i was testing with lines, not spans.
2014-07-02 09:26:05	simpson	Right. vi performs the multiplication in memory before altering the working buffer.

2014-07-02 10:01:33	shirgan	Is there any way to change what program Chromium uses to open files? Right now it's using GNOME Document Previewer for PDFs but I want it to use Evince.
2014-07-02 10:01:42	ekemsend	install firefox?
2014-07-02 10:02:08	ekemsend	you can open up settings and change the binary youd like
2014-07-02 10:02:15	shirgan	In Windows I would use Default Applications but I'm not sure if there's an analogous way to do it in Linux.
2014-07-02 10:02:21	lrr	shirgan: i think you need to control that in xdg settings
2014-07-02 10:02:29	mythmon	it might be a chromium setting.
2014-07-02 10:02:34	lrr	iirc chrome doesn't use a mimetype-like system like firefox does
2014-07-02 10:02:36	ekemsend	its chromium
2014-07-02 10:03:03	ekemsend	bretty sure, although using botnet browser while using linux can be irony
2014-07-02 10:03:29	ekemsend	otherwise if you are in xfce try just right clicking the document
2014-07-02 10:03:36	ekemsend	and properties
2014-07-02 10:05:20	shirgan	I might actually just switch to Firefox if it ends up being easier to do from there.
2014-07-02 10:05:32	shirgan	I'm not really attached to specific browsers.
2014-07-02 10:05:41	mythmon	firefox++
2014-07-02 10:06:10	ekemsend	firefox is the winner man
2014-07-02 10:06:15	edunham	i've never managed to figure out where all those defaults get set
2014-07-02 10:06:19	ekemsend	even though this last year they went to webkit
2014-07-02 10:06:28	ekemsend	annnnd added dmc
2014-07-02 10:06:37	edunham	on my personal laptop, some links opened from irc default to chromium and others default to firefox
2014-07-02 10:06:39	ekemsend	or the rights management in with 29, they still arent google
2014-07-02 10:06:46	ekemsend	ah yeah i gotcha
2014-07-02 10:06:55	edunham	even though my wm, terminator, and shell settings all say use firefox
2014-07-02 10:06:59	 *	edunham shrugs
2014-07-02 10:07:12	ekemsend	wierd whacky
2014-07-02 10:07:33	ekemsend	ive had bad experiences with chromium besides it being botnet
2014-07-02 10:07:52	ekemsend	for instance currently the build of chromium in debian jessie
2014-07-02 10:07:57	ekemsend	crashes X and closes all bines
2014-07-02 10:07:59	ekemsend	bins
2014-07-02 10:08:01	ekemsend	nice.
2014-07-02 10:08:26	edunham	huh whatever version pacman gave me on my arch setup hasn't had those issues
2014-07-02 10:08:30	shirgan	ekemsend: Can you explain what you mean by botnet?
2014-07-02 10:08:55	shirgan	In any case, downloading Firefox now.
2014-07-02 10:09:48	ekemsend	botnet when applied to anything software
2014-07-02 10:09:54	ekemsend	usually means its a) closed source
2014-07-02 10:10:02	ekemsend	or b) phones home with info about you
2014-07-02 10:10:03	edunham	ekemsend: i keep two browsers because I like Google's custom search results most of the time but there are namespace conflicts between my work/code and other hobbies

2014-07-02 10:10:22	ekemsend	haha
2014-07-02 10:10:43	edunham	nah like i maintain websites, and i also sew
2014-07-02 10:10:45	ekemsend	shirgan: the point is these days advertisers, businesses, and government agencies target you
2014-07-02 10:10:55	ekemsend	and suck your private info out as fast as you can
2014-07-02 10:11:03	edunham	work-me needs 'patchwork' to point to django tools; hobbies-me needs 'patchwork' to point to quilting blogs
2014-07-02 10:11:07	ekemsend	google-analytics and chrome help this
2014-07-02 10:11:51	ekemsend	if your personal machine is harvested by a software maker to do something you didnt intend, or is transparent to you the user
2014-07-02 10:11:53	ekemsend	its botnet
2014-07-02 10:12:03	edunham	ekemsend: i take it you've seen that thing that tells you what demographics google thinks you're in
2014-07-02 10:12:06	ekemsend	because your machine is being botted and included in a larger group of machines
2014-07-02 10:12:16	ekemsend	edunham: haha no i have seen explicit images
2014-07-02 10:12:43	ekemsend	edunham: this is just a on going thing with gergle snice they started making money
2014-07-02 10:12:56	edunham	ekemsend: well yeah you've been on the internet, explicit images are kinda inevitable
2014-07-02 10:13:03	ekemsend	haha
2014-07-02 10:13:05	edunham	i don't see how they're relevant here though :P
2014-07-02 10:13:10	ekemsend	i meant haven't
2014-07-02 10:13:18	edunham	oh lemme find you a link
2014-07-02 10:13:21	ekemsend	cool thanks
2014-07-02 10:13:31	ekemsend	the real danger comes when you take googles info
2014-07-02 10:13:37	ekemsend	and pair it with a credit agency
2014-07-02 10:13:54	ekemsend	pair it with hospital records, satellite imagery, and then let the feds suck it up

2014-07-02 10:14:04	mythmon	ekemsend: "even though last year they went to webkit" - false. you're thinking of opera.

2014-07-02 10:15:16	ekemsend	oh yeah ive seen that badboy before. they are sucking at getting me
2014-07-02 10:15:21	ekemsend	of course i block javascript with noscript
2014-07-02 10:15:24	ekemsend	and have domain requests off
2014-07-02 10:15:47	edunham	ya i manage to partition my search habits pretty cleanly between code and not-code
2014-07-02 10:15:49	ekemsend	jesus drm, sorry i just got up
2014-07-02 10:16:15	mythmon	you're referring to EME, encrypted media extensions.

2014-07-02 10:16:28	terrellt	This is what I get for leaving chrome logged in at home.
2014-07-02 10:16:54	mythmon	we see this as another nail in the coffin of flash.
2014-07-02 10:17:03	ekemsend	yes, flash is dead it seems
2014-07-02 10:17:09	mythmon	since flash is mainly used for drm now. we aren't adding drm to the web, we are making the drm that is already in the web better.
2014-07-02 10:17:21	ekemsend	haha
2014-07-02 10:17:31	terrellt	Oh, so library news - we have a second printer (Makerbot 2x - dual extrusion!) and a 3d scanner.
2014-07-02 10:17:51	ekemsend	nice, how do you get access to it?

2014-07-02 10:19:08	ekemsend	oh thats neat we can just submit files

2014-07-02 10:19:52	ekemsend	not plus
2014-07-02 10:19:58	ekemsend	and then you really just need
2014-07-02 10:20:00	ekemsend	firebug
2014-07-02 10:20:07	mythmon	NB: adblock (all varieties) eats memory.
2014-07-02 10:20:08	ekemsend	for dat web design and seeing headers
2014-07-02 10:20:13	ekemsend	yeah they do
2014-07-02 10:20:16	ekemsend	much better in 29 though
2014-07-02 10:20:19	ekemsend	not 3 gigs
2014-07-02 10:20:23	mythmon	firebug makes firefox so slow, and the built in dev tools are better now.
2014-07-02 10:20:27	ekemsend	but not seeing a youtube video is awesome
2014-07-02 10:20:33	ekemsend	and then last 2 are
2014-07-02 10:20:38	 *	edunham uses someonewhocares.org/hosts and rarely gets enough ads to warrant installing adblock
2014-07-02 10:20:45	ekemsend	noscript to have an additive model for removing js

2014-07-02 10:21:24	ekemsend	yeah firebug on the new ff is slow for sure

2014-07-02 10:27:46	mythmon	edunham: i see.
2014-07-02 10:27:58	ekemsend	good tip
2014-07-02 10:28:17	ekemsend	FF isnt nearly the kludge it was with ABE and tabs
2014-07-02 10:28:19	ekemsend	which is nice
2014-07-02 10:28:26	ekemsend	and it literally blocks every fucking ad
2014-07-02 10:28:44	ekemsend	unline ABP which has some grey listed stuff that is paid to get off the list i think
2014-07-02 10:29:28	terrellt	ekemsend: Which you can turn off.
2014-07-02 10:30:08	ekemsend	ah ok
2014-07-02 10:30:25	ekemsend	https://bitbucket.org/adstomper/adblockedge
2014-07-02 10:31:07	terrellt	bitbucket++ Free private repositories deserves karma.
2014-07-02 10:33:06	ekemsend	god yes
2014-07-02 10:33:25	ekemsend	except bitbucket is most hated because they allow male shauvinist authors
2014-07-02 10:33:36	ekemsend	and dont check their male privilege
2014-07-02 10:34:21	ekemsend	i cant imagine the cost of bandwidth
2014-07-02 10:34:32	ekemsend	but yiou can rent a vps for cheap and run git for yourself
2014-07-02 10:34:39	ekemsend	or mercurial
2014-07-02 10:34:58	terrellt	Free < $5/mo.
2014-07-02 10:35:32	ekemsend	freedom is slavery.
2014-07-02 10:35:38	ekemsend	slavery is freedom.
2014-07-02 10:35:39	terrellt	That being said, https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/
2014-07-02 10:35:43	terrellt	^ Also free.
2014-07-02 10:36:01	edunham	gitlab++
2014-07-02 10:36:01	ekemsend	no honestly no real complaints except github has pulled projects that were racist
2014-07-02 10:36:03	ekemsend	or sexist
2014-07-02 10:36:19	ekemsend	which no thanks on that level of censorship
2014-07-02 10:36:48	terrellt	Github's got my business for as long as they want it.
2014-07-02 10:36:57	edunham	ekemsend: yeah there's no good solution, and the cost of having humans review every repo seems overwhelming
2014-07-02 10:37:17	edunham	community moderation kinda helps -- if you don't like a project, don't star or fork or contribute, and it'll wither
2014-07-02 10:37:28	ekemsend	edunham: its probably similar to googles problem of going through youtube videos
2014-07-02 10:37:33	ekemsend	except there are no templates to match
2014-07-02 10:37:40	ekemsend	just ambiguous lines of characters
2014-07-02 10:38:17	ekemsend	by google i mean youtubes copyright searchers

2014-07-02 10:39:22	ekemsend	no place to remove a codebase
2014-07-02 10:39:24	ekemsend	like at all
2014-07-02 10:39:39	ekemsend	i dont care if its a virus or if it uses slurs for variable names
2014-07-02 10:39:54	edunham	yeah moderation is hard
2014-07-02 10:40:18	edunham	and once you get censorship in place, you have no way to differentiate between someone who actually was harmed and someone who's merely parodying having been harmed to make a statement
2014-07-02 10:40:39	edunham	so the options are all, nothing, or getting yelled at for drawing the line in the middle wrong :P
2014-07-02 10:41:39	ekemsend	eh only when viewed from the outside by non users is their drama 9/10
2014-07-02 10:41:46	ekemsend	there
2014-07-02 10:42:16	ekemsend	of course if i was a parent there would be a long list of sites i would WANT to censor

2014-07-02 10:45:20	terrellt	If I had a kid and discovered they'd set up a VPS to bypass security measures I could only be proud.
2014-07-02 10:45:52	pingveno	ekemsend: openssl got pwnt, better switch to rust-crypto. :)
2014-07-02 10:45:52	edunham	yeah if  i ever have kids i'd be tempted to start with really flimsy security and gradually ramp it up just to see how they get around it :)
2014-07-02 10:45:55	ekemsend	terrellt: id promote that if i could, like feed the kid an account that he thinks is hidden from me
2014-07-02 10:46:06	edunham	"your reward for breaking RSA is facebook for the end of the week"
2014-07-02 10:46:06	ekemsend	terrellt: train him like a terrorist i guess
2014-07-02 10:46:17	terrellt	edunham++ ekemsend++
2014-07-02 10:46:22	shirgan	edunham++
2014-07-02 10:46:26	ekemsend	gentoo--
2014-07-02 10:46:52	pingveno	Are you suggesting using evolutionary pressures on children?
2014-07-02 10:46:57	terrellt	^ Yes.
2014-07-02 10:46:58	ekemsend	anyone following libressl
2014-07-02 10:47:15	lrr	anyone here good at iptables AND ip6tables?
2014-07-02 10:47:18	ekemsend	haha yeah its used to get un in academia and into a 9-5
2014-07-02 10:47:24	pingveno	ekemsend: How is Gentoo killing you now?
2014-07-02 10:47:24	ekemsend	haha NO!
2014-07-02 10:47:35	ekemsend	you have to nuke something pingveno
2014-07-02 10:47:58	ekemsend	ill probably get gentoo to 0
2014-07-02 10:48:01	ekemsend	and up perl next
2014-07-02 10:48:07	ekemsend	because perl.
2014-07-02 10:48:56	pingveno	I thought Perl's karma was supposed to be going down, not up.
2014-07-02 10:49:22	ekemsend	yes, the contradiction itself will draw interest
2014-07-02 10:49:25	ekemsend	and feed perl karma
2014-07-02 10:49:33	edunham	!score gentoo
2014-07-02 10:49:33	@hamper	gentoo has 2 points
2014-07-02 10:49:37	ekemsend	bless(this operation)
2014-07-02 10:49:42	 *	terrellt abuses library privileges to 3d print a tardis first.
2014-07-02 10:49:45	ekemsend	i cant compete edunham plz no D:
2014-07-02 10:49:45	edunham	gentoo++
2014-07-02 10:50:19	edunham	it keeps our really old systems stable by guaranteeing we never touch anything on them :P
2014-07-02 10:50:25	ekemsend	lilwayne++
2014-07-02 10:50:33	ekemsend	oh you are running gentoo as a server?
2014-07-02 10:50:54	edunham	gentoo servers exist in places where i've had to "maintain" them, yes
2014-07-02 10:51:03	ekemsend	heh
2014-07-02 10:51:07	ekemsend	neat.
2014-07-02 10:51:49	ekemsend	so i take it there is a lot of python use in here
2014-07-02 10:51:55	terrellt	ruby++
2014-07-02 10:52:02	ekemsend	anyone have a resource on getting python up and running with nginx
2014-07-02 10:52:09	ekemsend	without using a cms like django
2014-07-02 10:52:15	ekemsend	aka fast-cgi i guess?
2014-07-02 10:52:37	terrellt	I assume there's a rack equivalent for python that just does the HTTP talking.
2014-07-02 10:52:53	ekemsend	http://worldanchor.net/dmp/crawl.webm
2014-07-02 10:53:00	ekemsend	well you can use a domdocument model
2014-07-02 10:53:10	edunham	ekemsend: what're you building?
2014-07-02 10:53:11	ekemsend	and generate pages like in php im sure, or use templating to print out elements
2014-07-02 10:53:17	terrellt	WSGI maybe?
2014-07-02 10:53:24	ekemsend	yeahhhh that sounds about right
2014-07-02 10:53:37	ekemsend	im not sure how to just get it going, ive done domdoc a lot with php
2014-07-02 10:53:44	ekemsend	python has almost nothing like it, maybe minidom
2014-07-02 10:54:01	pingveno	minidom for a DOM implementation?
2014-07-02 10:54:03	terrellt	For exploring DOMs?
2014-07-02 10:54:18	pingveno	terrellt: minidom is part of the stdlib
2014-07-02 10:54:21	ekemsend	more for generating, im using beautifulsoup to parse
2014-07-02 10:54:37	ekemsend	in php you can easily generate a dom with their class for it
2014-07-02 10:54:42	pingveno	Yeah... the DOM and Python are icky
2014-07-02 10:55:02	pingveno	lxml or BeautifulSoup are much better
2014-07-02 10:55:07	ekemsend	python im worried im going to be template1="<headh>{1}</head>".format(**foobar)
2014-07-02 10:55:07	terrellt	Right, in ruby you use nokogiri.
2014-07-02 10:55:10	pingveno	Or ElementTree
2014-07-02 10:55:30	ekemsend	but i wasnt looking forward to more php, so i wanted to press on
2014-07-02 10:55:45	ekemsend	any halp is good halp for wsgi i guess
2014-07-02 10:55:46	terrellt	Any particular reason you're avoiding micro frameworks?
2014-07-02 10:55:55	terrellt	Like, it's fun, but kind of self defeating.
2014-07-02 10:56:02	ekemsend	terrellt: ive deployed django before, its not bad
2014-07-02 10:56:06	ekemsend	but see i have some irc bots
2014-07-02 10:56:07	terrellt	Well sure
2014-07-02 10:56:10	terrellt	But there's always flask.
2014-07-02 10:56:19	ekemsend	and minecraft servers, that i want to take data from
2014-07-02 10:56:41	ekemsend	so see they run on different machines, and i can write a custome socket interface and do IPC on irc etc
2014-07-02 10:56:55	ekemsend	so i wasnt tooo interested in learning a framework to do what i need,
2014-07-02 10:57:05	ekemsend	might as well just do it the hard way
2014-07-02 10:57:29	terrellt	I'd at least get something with a router.
2014-07-02 10:57:32	ekemsend	i think i remember looking at flask, ill give it a shot
2014-07-02 10:57:35	terrellt	Otherwise it's just going to hurt.
2014-07-02 10:57:39	ekemsend	terrellt: mind explaining router?
2014-07-02 10:57:44	ekemsend	oh packet router?
2014-07-02 10:57:56	terrellt	No, if you're writing a web application you're going to want to assign paths to actions.
2014-07-02 10:58:06	ekemsend	ah ok
2014-07-02 10:58:21	ekemsend	so with php i would serve a class with switches
2014-07-02 10:58:31	ekemsend	python im just not sure what the design idiom is
2014-07-02 10:58:45	terrellt	What are you trying to do exactly?
2014-07-02 10:58:56	terrellt	Because I might not agree with your PHP either.
2014-07-02 10:59:05	ekemsend	i would like to have a sql backend, no particular relational db
2014-07-02 10:59:18	pingveno	Flask-SQLAlchemy?
2014-07-02 10:59:20	terrellt	Lol, so you want an ORM.
2014-07-02 10:59:34	ekemsend	so in the past ive done like mysql backend
2014-07-02 10:59:48	ekemsend	filled with decently large mixed dbs, ... that webscale
2014-07-02 10:59:51	ekemsend	no...
2014-07-02 10:59:57	ekemsend	anyway id read from them and fill a dom doc
2014-07-02 11:00:00	terrellt	Lol, webscale.
2014-07-02 11:00:13	ekemsend	then serve teh dom doc straight to user
2014-07-02 11:00:18	ekemsend	not templating
2014-07-02 11:00:23	terrellt	So you want an application that pulls information from a database and writes an HTML document.
2014-07-02 11:00:28	ekemsend	haha ^
2014-07-02 11:00:40	ekemsend	writes dynamic pages for the most part
2014-07-02 11:00:50	ekemsend	i like to have a class with a newElement()
2014-07-02 11:00:58	terrellt	Why.
2014-07-02 11:00:59	ekemsend	where you can pass the element and args
2014-07-02 11:01:11	ekemsend	because it makes automation and building new pages fast
2014-07-02 11:01:37	ekemsend	pagedraw.ne('title',....)
2014-07-02 11:02:06	ekemsend	you can place things in arrays and save them for later print at will, its a nice creation tool
2014-07-02 11:02:40	terrellt	Excuse me if I'm misunderstanding, but you're hiding HTML behind a factory. It's hard to look at and a nightmare to maintain. Not to mention the implementation is secret, so I doubt the HTML generation is faster.
2014-07-02 11:02:41	pingveno	Any particular reason not to just use a template?
2014-07-02 11:02:57	terrellt	HTML isn't bad.
2014-07-02 11:03:03	terrellt	HTML is good.
2014-07-02 11:03:04	ekemsend	terrellt: its not bad at all if you use something like a CMS model
2014-07-02 11:03:23	ekemsend	cmv excuse me
2014-07-02 11:03:34	terrellt	It has nothing to do with a CMS. You're generating HTML from code, but there's no point to it.
2014-07-02 11:03:46	ekemsend	heh
2014-07-02 11:03:59	ekemsend	its like a cnc machine to a paintbrush bro, no point in arguing that one
2014-07-02 11:04:12	ekemsend	the cms is just for organization
2014-07-02 11:04:19	ekemsend	like a page draw goes in the view class/object
2014-07-02 11:04:28	ekemsend	and backed sql goes in the machine object
2014-07-02 11:04:47	ekemsend	and you can deal with the communication between on a page call to get the page youd like
2014-07-02 11:04:56	ekemsend	its a bit more like jquery
2014-07-02 11:05:06	terrellt	Yes, you can choose which template you render in the same way.
2014-07-02 11:05:09	ekemsend	echo "<table"> is slow as bananas in design
2014-07-02 11:05:14	terrellt	LOL what?
2014-07-02 11:05:16	ekemsend	and hard to edit
2014-07-02 11:05:25	ekemsend	if you render a static page its faster to GET
2014-07-02 11:05:35	ekemsend	but to design i feel the code is hard to manage
2014-07-02 11:05:41	ekemsend	just my experience is all
2014-07-02 11:05:58	ekemsend	but that being said i am open to templating with python for sure
2014-07-02 11:06:18	terrellt	I'm confused as heck. I don't understand what you think is faster.
2014-07-02 11:06:21	ekemsend	as i think thats how its done
2014-07-02 11:06:27	ekemsend	um maybe i have an example somewhere
2014-07-02 11:09:36	<--	MichaelC (~unknownbl@phpbb/website/Unknown-Bliss) has quit (Changing host)
2014-07-02 11:09:36	-->	MichaelC (~unknownbl@phpbb/website/MichaelC) has joined #osu-lug
2014-07-02 11:10:56	ekemsend	i have no idea where the last version i worked on is
2014-07-02 11:11:00	ekemsend	but i do have backups
2014-07-02 11:11:02	ekemsend	http://pastebin.com/2UVUjpGb
2014-07-02 11:11:21	ekemsend	not sure what this realllllly looks like but here is a base class i might use with some functions for creating a page
2014-07-02 11:11:29	-->	thedjpetersen (~subway@somawa.com) has joined #osu-lug
2014-07-02 11:11:56	ekemsend	disregard any terrible design problems as php was the language i used to get back into computing after a long time not
2014-07-02 11:11:59	ekemsend	and probably many mistakes
2014-07-02 11:12:40	terrellt	echo $this->dom->saveHTML(); <-- I can almost guaruntee this is slower than parsing a template.
2014-07-02 11:12:42	ekemsend	ne() is the element creation function and takes an array of attr
2014-07-02 11:12:55	ekemsend	terrellt: yes indeed in terms of serving, although its not a huge difference
2014-07-02 11:13:06	terrellt	So you agree it's slower.
2014-07-02 11:13:11	terrellt	It's also harder to read.
2014-07-02 11:13:15	terrellt	What's the benefit here?
2014-07-02 11:13:15	ekemsend	remember that generating a static page is always faster no matter what, but i was talking about: design
2014-07-02 11:13:18	ekemsend	and ease of use
2014-07-02 11:13:25	ekemsend	thats not a page terrellt
2014-07-02 11:13:28	ekemsend	let me find a page
2014-07-02 11:14:52	ekemsend	heres like just the entry point in a page
2014-07-02 11:14:53	ekemsend	http://pastebin.com/CmbwaQ5k
2014-07-02 11:15:05	ekemsend	the goal is to boil down common elements used in a page to a single function
2014-07-02 11:15:25	ekemsend	like $page->drawTable(5,10)
2014-07-02 11:16:55	ekemsend	heres a stack shortie on the topic
2014-07-02 11:16:57	ekemsend	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19482826/using-domdocument-to-create-elements-in-an-html-file
2014-07-02 11:17:11	ekemsend	believe me i questioned the method myself, as its more like javascript
2014-07-02 11:17:43	terrellt	What you've done makes sense if you're dealing with pages whose initial state is not under your control.
2014-07-02 11:18:14	ekemsend	yes that was the problem
2014-07-02 11:18:25	ekemsend	it was a backend for a user group that could trade items by ids
2014-07-02 11:18:31	ekemsend	and have a store display etc
2014-07-02 11:18:34	terrellt	What I mean by that is if you're curling an external HTML page
2014-07-02 11:18:41	terrellt	And want to change it.
2014-07-02 11:18:43	ekemsend	ah after parsing
2014-07-02 11:18:56	ekemsend	yeah it makes that easier, in my mind because of benefits like that
2014-07-02 11:19:03	ekemsend	there was no reason to create two api's for a site
2014-07-02 11:19:13	terrellt	If you're generating the WHOLE page though, your maintainability goes way up if your markup is inline with business logic for determining what content goes where.
2014-07-02 11:19:14	ekemsend	so if i wanted to plug into a curled page i could
2014-07-02 11:19:34	ekemsend	hmm terrellt i am listening, but when i have a well defined surface for communication with objects
2014-07-02 11:19:39	ekemsend	doesnt that make it easier?
2014-07-02 11:20:21	ekemsend	i can see the cascade of failures the dependency on an api that has "reach" for sure, like burying a bug at a low level
2014-07-02 11:20:37	ekemsend	but i think if we did a tldr;
2014-07-02 11:20:44	ekemsend	python has a bad dom model, so dont even worry about it/
2014-07-02 11:20:46	ekemsend	?
2014-07-02 11:20:54	terrellt	Let me put it this way. HTML has a clearly defined specification which allows it to be a commonality between developers. Look at that code.
2014-07-02 11:20:55	ekemsend	suck it up nancy boy and template?
2014-07-02 11:21:12	ekemsend	oh terrellt heh its not a text markup if thats what you mean
2014-07-02 11:21:18	ekemsend	its meant to be either a personal api
2014-07-02 11:21:33	ekemsend	or if documented and rewritten, just a toolset
2014-07-02 11:21:57	ekemsend	regardless i am more interested in how it can be done in python at this point
2014-07-02 11:22:18	ekemsend	all of those classes can burn for my concern level
2014-07-02 11:22:43	ekemsend	oh terrellt i see your point... im never changing the syntax of an element
2014-07-02 11:22:52	terrellt	I promise you generating HTML from helper methods causes more pain than help, because the abstraction hurts understanding.
2014-07-02 11:22:54	ekemsend	an element always has a name and attributes
2014-07-02 11:23:05	terrellt	But in any case.
2014-07-02 11:23:29	ekemsend	terrellt: i wont disagree, but this is a personal project, so you have to look at scope
2014-07-02 11:23:39	terrellt	I hate to do it, but I'll just say go with templating.
2014-07-02 11:23:42	ekemsend	if for this user it is the desired solution, than it is the solution
2014-07-02 11:23:43	terrellt	And partials.
2014-07-02 11:23:52	ekemsend	ok thanks man, thats kind of the vibe i got
2014-07-02 11:24:02	ekemsend	i tried to parse on page in minidom and shit exploded
2014-07-02 11:24:07	terrellt	Personal projects should be learning opportunities.
2014-07-02 11:24:11	ekemsend	then i tried to switch parsers and i about died
2014-07-02 11:24:11	terrellt	In my opinion.
2014-07-02 11:24:29	 *	thedjpetersen is trying to parse the scrollback
2014-07-02 11:24:41	ekemsend	<&fsdf>
2014-07-02 11:24:44	ekemsend	there broke it
2014-07-02 11:24:50	edunham	thedjpetersen: probably better to request re-asking questions at this point
2014-07-02 11:24:53	edunham	scrollback is huge
2014-07-02 11:25:36	terrellt	thedjpetersen: Effectively ekemsend wants a way in python to inject objects into his DOM from code.
2014-07-02 11:26:05	ekemsend	or generate from ground up
2014-07-02 11:26:18	terrellt	=(
2014-07-02 11:26:20	ekemsend	either from a mysql table or a text file or whatever
2014-07-02 11:26:29	ekemsend	yeah im going to 0 to page
2014-07-02 11:26:46	ekemsend	hahahaha how about i use the php code to generate a page
2014-07-02 11:26:55	ekemsend	then traverse and insert into the dom with python? hows that?
2014-07-02 11:27:02	terrellt	=((((
2014-07-02 11:27:04	ekemsend	haha
2014-07-02 11:27:08	thedjpetersen	send it as paged json?
2014-07-02 11:27:12	ekemsend	its called "what i learned at osu"
2014-07-02 11:27:41	thedjpetersen	python objects usually serialize pretty nicely to JSON
2014-07-02 11:27:48	ekemsend	thedjpetersen: well i still need to figure out how python likes best to write an .html page
2014-07-02 11:27:54	ekemsend	or serve the user
2014-07-02 11:28:13	ekemsend	so you think serve a json and gen with javascript?
2014-07-02 11:28:22	thedjpetersen	ekemsend: how big is your dataset?
2014-07-02 11:28:38	ekemsend	its going to probably end up with tables under 5000 each
2014-07-02 11:28:43	ekemsend	maybe 5 tables in the end?
2014-07-02 11:28:54	thedjpetersen	I wouldn't generate a static page with that many rows
2014-07-02 11:29:03	ekemsend	yeah ill use ajax calls for sure
2014-07-02 11:29:07	ekemsend	ok i get your point
2014-07-02 11:29:09	ekemsend	nice...
2014-07-02 11:29:27	ekemsend	i was explaining how ive used php primarily to gen pages with the domdoc
2014-07-02 11:29:29	thedjpetersen	Python has a pretty good static server built right in
2014-07-02 11:29:31	terrellt	thedjpetersen: I think you're misunderstanding. He wants to avoid doing for item in bla { "<tr><td>item.attribute</td></tr>" } and instead do table_generator(bla0
2014-07-02 11:29:45	ekemsend	yeah trying to avoid long strings for elements
2014-07-02 11:29:46	thedjpetersen	I don't think you'll have to generate the page
2014-07-02 11:29:52	thedjpetersen	I think you'll just want one static html page
2014-07-02 11:29:59	thedjpetersen	serve that
2014-07-02 11:30:04	ekemsend	ok
2014-07-02 11:30:16	ekemsend	and like do extra with jquery
2014-07-02 11:30:25	thedjpetersen	I would use flask
2014-07-02 11:30:27	ekemsend	with a json being served i guess?
2014-07-02 11:30:36	ekemsend	thats two for flask
2014-07-02 11:30:40	thedjpetersen	that could serve the static page and handle the API endpoints
2014-07-02 11:30:44	ekemsend	thanks a lot guys i was at a deadend here
2014-07-02 11:30:51	thedjpetersen	URL routing can be a little tricky
2014-07-02 11:30:58	ekemsend	thats my other thing
2014-07-02 11:31:07	ekemsend	how do you send a GET to python i gues WSGI
2014-07-02 11:31:15	terrellt	Flask will take care of the dance.
2014-07-02 11:31:16	thedjpetersen	terrellt: like a magic method named "table_generator" ?
2014-07-02 11:31:32	terrellt	thedjpetersen: Yes, which calls something that generates HTML, rather than just writing out the HTML.
2014-07-02 11:31:37	ekemsend	as a masochist, i wish there was at least 1 decent resource on this
2014-07-02 11:31:45	terrellt	I'd give a ruby synonym, but it's a bunch of python devs in here.
2014-07-02 11:31:46	thedjpetersen	well....ok
2014-07-02 11:31:46	ekemsend	and not just install django and wireshark
2014-07-02 11:31:53	thedjpetersen	just define your table
2014-07-02 11:31:55	thedjpetersen	its not that tough
2014-07-02 11:32:02	ekemsend	ive goofed with ruby, not my thing yet
2014-07-02 11:32:06	terrellt	Yes, I've been trying to convince him.
2014-07-02 11:32:16	ekemsend	haha no you scorned
2014-07-02 11:32:26	ekemsend	thedjpetersen offers unbiased input so far :P
2014-07-02 11:32:31	terrellt	I said I disagree and tried to tell you why.
2014-07-02 11:32:38	 *	thedjpetersen grabs popcorn
2014-07-02 11:32:40	ekemsend	haha
2014-07-02 11:32:45	terrellt	But in any case!
2014-07-02 11:32:49	terrellt	Flask will take care of your URL routing.
2014-07-02 11:33:03	terrellt	Then it just executes as a python app.
2014-07-02 11:33:03	ekemsend	is that again a socket connection?
2014-07-02 11:33:10	ekemsend	like AF_LOCAL?
2014-07-02 11:33:39	terrellt	http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/fastcgi/
2014-07-02 11:33:52	terrellt	If you want to host out of nginx.
2014-07-02 11:34:00	ekemsend	import WSGIServer
2014-07-02 11:34:02	terrellt	http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/uwsgi/ Also works.
2014-07-02 11:34:02	ekemsend	nice thanks
2014-07-02 11:34:16	ekemsend	thats basically what i was looking for man, very nice
2014-07-02 11:34:41	terrellt	Flask will open a port if you just run python myapp.py though.
2014-07-02 11:34:43	ekemsend	ive got fastcgi currenly going but i had no idea how to hook into it with python
2014-07-02 11:34:48	ekemsend	so this is awesome
2014-07-02 11:36:48	ekemsend	so now this question will probably get me torn in two
2014-07-02 11:36:59	jnoah	simpson: another vim question. Difference between ce and de?
2014-07-02 11:37:06	ekemsend	but ive gone with python3 out of the gate, reason not too?
2014-07-02 11:37:11	mythmon	jnoah: ce leaves you in insert mode after.
2014-07-02 11:37:16	mythmon	ekemsend: library support.
2014-07-02 11:37:22	jnoah	i know d is delet and c is change, but they seem to do the same thing
2014-07-02 11:37:27	jnoah	oh
2014-07-02 11:37:39	mythmon	ekemsend: if all the libraries you want to use are supported in python3, go for it.
2014-07-02 11:37:49	jnoah	derp, that's what the last line of the lesson says
2014-07-02 11:37:59	mythmon	jnoah: c and d are indeed, almost identical, it is just whether you are in insert mode afterwards.
2014-07-02 11:38:00	 *	jnoah can read, he swears
2014-07-02 11:38:10	ekemsend	mythmon: nice thanks
2014-07-02 11:38:14	Mathuin	I will occasionally use 'cw' in vi but never 'dw.
2014-07-02 11:38:18	simpson	c and d also change what's in the ". buffer.
2014-07-02 11:38:22	ekemsend	jnoah: heres my .vimrc if you want examples
2014-07-02 11:38:24	ekemsend	http://pastebin.com/hRjq76Gt
2014-07-02 11:38:33	ekemsend	nothing special but the display char stuff at the bottom is nice
2014-07-02 11:38:40	mythmon	jnoah: have you learned about i and a motions yet?
2014-07-02 11:38:48	jnoah	ekemsend: i've used vim for a long time. just haven't ever used the tutorial and am learning a couple things here and there
2014-07-02 11:38:53	simpson	Which means that things like ci" can be repeated with . on subsequent "quoted regions"
2014-07-02 11:38:54	jnoah	mythmon: yeah
2014-07-02 11:38:58	ekemsend	oh baller dude, nice
2014-07-02 11:39:10	terrellt	ci" is my favorite thing ever.

2014-07-02 11:57:22	jnoah	woh, so :r has very limited use, but is quite awesome
2014-07-02 11:58:22	jnoah	open vim and try :r !ls
2014-07-02 11:58:30	jnoah	or :r <some file>
2014-07-02 11:58:34	Mathuin	I only use the . buffer for substitutions.
2014-07-02 11:58:43	Mathuin	jnoah: I do that with !!, if it's what I think you're doing.
2014-07-02 12:01:20	ekemsend	say you wanted to bind +"gP to a keyboard shortcut like super+v
2014-07-02 12:01:31	ekemsend	vim provide a way to do that at all?
2014-07-02 12:01:33	ekemsend	or gvim?
2014-07-02 12:02:10	ekemsend	i guess a keyboard macro, but im not that wizard
2014-07-02 12:09:40	ekemsend	i..is that tox support in flask?
2014-07-02 12:15:42	mythmon	ekemsend: i have this in my vimrc:

2014-07-02 12:16:01	mythmon	<leader> is \ for me.
2014-07-02 12:16:11	mythmon	you could probably do something like ^h or something to get other keys.
2014-07-02 12:19:02	ekemsend	oh ok yeah i see

2014-07-02 12:36:31	ekemsend	be nice to have a better shortcut
2014-07-02 13:06:44	edunham	bitbucket-- does not appear to support ecdsa keys :C
2014-07-02 13:06:57	jnoah	edunham: neither does github
2014-07-02 13:07:02	jnoah	unless they changed that recently
2014-07-02 13:07:12	jnoah	(within ~3weeks)
2014-07-02 13:07:27	edunham	jnoah: they've supported it since before i wrote my git talk for PSU
2014-07-02 13:07:52	jnoah	weird, i could have sworn I tried recently without success. good to know though
2014-07-02 13:07:58	 *	edunham has been using ecdsa for main gh keys for like 2months
2014-07-02 13:07:59	Mathuin	Doesn't EC have an NSA backdoor?
2014-07-02 13:08:22	edunham	Mathuin: what doesn't?
2014-07-02 13:08:37	edunham	ok, less snarky answer is that i don't know off the top of my head but would enjoy a link to a credible source on the matter
2014-07-02 13:08:50	Mathuin	Ah, it's Dual EC_DRBG that was basically developed by the NSA and according to Snowden had backdoors added.
2014-07-02 13:09:08	Mathuin	That algorithm got pulled by the NIST from the draft.
2014-07-02 13:09:26	edunham	ah, ok
2014-07-02 13:09:46	edunham	i tend to blindly trust gh in some of these matters
2014-07-02 13:10:03	Mathuin	You have to blindly trust *someone* or else prove everything from axioms all day long.
2014-07-02 13:10:31	edunham	yep
2014-07-02 13:11:58	Mathuin	tential backdoor long before Snowden...

2014-07-02 13:23:33	Mathuin	http://www.salon.com/2002/08/28/0wnz0red/ -- reading about the encryption nonsense reminds me of this story by Cory Doctorow.  It's over a decade old, but still sorta relevant.
2014-07-02 13:34:18	leel8on	i think doctorow is going to be in pdx next week
2014-07-02 13:35:20	Mathuin	I haven't seen him speak.  Might be worth the trip in my copious free time.
2014-07-02 13:36:05	edunham	oh damn, that's next week?
2014-07-02 13:36:09	edunham	i guess it is

2014-07-02 15:20:51	Mathuin	I like the github magic for closing issues in commit messages, but it only seems to apply when you commit to master, not to develop.

2014-07-02 15:23:33	lrr	huh?

2014-07-02 15:25:34	Mathuin	Not until develop is merged into master, of course, in a release.
2014-07-02 15:26:31	lrr	in my usage, when i have an issue and I have a commit on a branch not master, then the github webui shows a reference
2014-07-02 15:26:40	lrr	or says something about ti will be closed when merged into master
2014-07-02 15:26:42	Mathuin	Huh.  Maybe I'm just impatient.
2014-07-02 15:28:26	Mathuin	Yeah, it's a lack of patience.
