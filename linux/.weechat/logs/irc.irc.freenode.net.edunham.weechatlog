2014-05-15 20:58:00	edunham	hope it went well

2014-05-28 16:34:14	muricula	can I hitch a ride to the schnier talk?
2014-05-28 16:34:30	edunham	if you don't mind the rather small middle back seat of my car, sure!
2014-05-28 16:34:59	edunham	6pm, 231 nw 11th, possible gathering-for-food-somewhere beforehand (see manatees)
2014-05-28 16:35:23	edunham	it's the big green-with-yellow-trim house, small teal car (and 2 other cars) in driveway
2014-05-28 16:35:27	edunham	can't miss it :)
2014-05-28 16:45:49	muricula	So I've reconsidered. I really should go to tschuy 's birthday, and I suspect I will see schneier give a talk again someday.
2014-05-28 16:46:00	edunham	uhh ok
2014-05-28 16:46:06	edunham	your call :)
2014-05-28 16:46:08	muricula	sorry to be indecisive
2014-05-28 16:46:25	edunham	it's fine
2014-05-28 16:46:40	edunham	i'll just take all the humans who are at my house at 6pm and stuff them into the car in priority order
2014-05-28 16:46:44	edunham	all will be well

2014-06-03 11:33:42	edunham	hey, you've been nominated for LUG president, VP, treasurer, and secretary. Do you accept all or some of these nominations? :)
2014-06-03 11:37:57	edunham	s/for/to run for/
2014-06-03 13:00:34	muricula	Oh dear
2014-06-03 13:01:28	muricula	I'm not sure about LUG President. The rest I will accept. By when do I need to tell you?
2014-06-03 13:06:18	edunham	the sooner I hear back from people the sooner I can send the ballots out :)
2014-06-03 13:06:36	edunham	it's fine to run for just VP/treasurer/secretary though
2014-06-03 13:06:42	muricula	Can I ask who else is running?
2014-06-03 13:06:50	muricula	For el presidente.
2014-06-03 13:08:34	edunham	you'll find out when the ballots come out
2014-06-03 13:08:46	edunham	don't worry about others -- run if you feel you're willing to invest the effort to do it well :)
2014-06-03 13:09:32	muricula	I just want to make sure that the club is in good hands, but I'm not sure whether I will have the time or energy for LUG
