2014-05-19 14:09:28	+jordane	manatee: is the speed of omnibus inversely proportional to the logs it outputs?

2014-05-19 14:10:14	+jordane	Ramereth: re-fixing chefdk, because opscode decided to rearrange it
2014-05-19 14:10:23	+jordane	before they'll accept a patch to make it build on debian
2014-05-19 14:10:33	+Ramereth	ah
2014-05-19 14:10:36	+jordane	Ramereth: but the new version of omnibus by default only outputs warn and error
2014-05-19 14:10:45	+jordane	and has a new syntax >.<
2014-05-19 14:11:07	+jordane	although the new syntax is actually better. It drops the literal use of 'project' in most commands
2014-05-19 14:12:17	chekkaa	basic`: ok, looks like it's still going
2014-05-19 14:12:23	+Ramereth	i can't even use the base role as a test as omnibus_updater isn't needed
2014-05-19 14:12:51	+Ramereth	chekkaa: is drupal-util still in bacula or now on the new backup system?
2014-05-19 14:13:20	+Ramereth	looks like /var/log is in the excludes in bacula
2014-05-19 14:16:21	chekkaa	Ramereth: looks like it's not in rdiff yet
2014-05-19 14:16:53	+Ramereth	jordane: is there any reason why we can't put the recipe dep of omnibus_updater in the base cookbook? That way I can at least put in an exception for the ppc64 arch
2014-05-19 14:17:32	+jordane	Ramereth: It should be split out into its own role that can be included.
2014-05-19 14:17:58	+jordane	I'm actually working on splitting out the base/managed roles & cookbooks into more manageable chunks
2014-05-19 14:19:26	+Ramereth	how does putting it in its own role work through the arch issue I'm running into?
2014-05-19 14:20:00	+Ramereth	shouldn't the logic be done in a cookbook?
2014-05-19 14:20:47	+jordane	Ramereth: because then you don't include the role. e.g base => smaller_base, omnibus_updater
2014-05-19 14:20:51	+jordane	and you just use smaller_base
2014-05-19 14:21:07	+Ramereth	huh?
2014-05-19 14:21:52	+jordane	Ramereth: the base role should basically only include other roles
2014-05-19 14:22:06	+jordane	so then you just make a new base_ppc role that doesn't include omnibus_updater
2014-05-19 14:22:21	+jordane	are the ppc machines in their own env? Or are they in production?
2014-05-19 14:22:32	+Ramereth	nothing yet, but i was testing it in prod
2014-05-19 14:22:40	+Ramereth	the nodes I'm going to be doign will be in their own openstack env though
2014-05-19 14:22:48	+Ramereth	but for now I'm just testing it in a vm on openstack
2014-05-19 14:22:59	+jordane	alright. I'd just make a ppc_base role and include base::managed for now.
2014-05-19 14:23:44	+Ramereth	i was only testing unmanaged for now
2014-05-19 14:23:48	+jordane	ah
2014-05-19 14:23:53	+jordane	then just ::unmanaged
2014-05-19 14:23:59	+Ramereth	its not going to be easy to fix everything
2014-05-19 14:24:42	+jordane	?
2014-05-19 14:24:50	+Ramereth	"base" pulls in unmanaged
2014-05-19 14:25:12	+jordane	Right. I'm not sure what you mean by fix everything.
2014-05-19 14:25:35	+Ramereth	i'm running into other misc problems because of the arch (i.e. dmidecode is an x86 only package)
2014-05-19 14:25:56	+jordane	Yeah :\

2014-05-19 14:35:50	+Ramereth	jordane: thoughts?

2014-05-19 14:37:46	+jordane	Ramereth: yeah, most people put them in $GIT_REPO/.chef/bootstrap, and then symlink/use knife from $GIT_REPO/whatever
2014-05-19 14:38:25	+Ramereth	would you like me to just put it in the .chef/bootstrap folder then?
2014-05-19 14:38:53	+jordane	+1, and add something in the docs about symlinking that in the settuping up your workstation doc.
2014-05-19 14:39:42	+Ramereth	i doubt we'll need other templates but just in case I can do that

2014-05-19 15:26:20	+Ramereth	you'd think there might be a better fork of it somewhere
2014-05-19 15:27:35	+jordane	probably. There aren't any published on the opscode api though.
2014-05-19 15:28:59	+Ramereth	well, we have that version locked in the prod env. can we at least upload the latest version and I can use that in the openstack env?

2014-05-19 15:49:07	lrr	and the openstack docs seem to suggest something different than this

2014-05-20 10:20:10	+jordane	an encrypted databag is just a databag that has encrypted values

2014-05-20 10:25:44	+zubriske	pwnguin: line 241 of the import log script has the regex crud.

2014-05-20 10:42:45	+jordane	that should be all the gems we're using as of nowish
2014-05-20 10:42:55	+Ramereth	jordane: shouldn't I be using the chefdk gem installer?

2014-05-20 14:16:26	+Ramereth	should I just push a minor version bump with the change I made?
2014-05-20 14:16:38	+Ramereth	and then submit a PR to add it to the upstream havana release?
2014-05-20 14:17:09	+jordane	hmm. That is a good question. Up until now, I've generally pushed a PR and waited, but obviously that doesn't make a whole lot of sense here.
2014-05-20 14:17:21	+Ramereth	i would rather not have to wait all the time
2014-05-20 14:17:24	+jordane	I guess I'm fine with a minor version bump
2014-05-20 14:17:37	+jordane	As long as you remember to remove it.
2014-05-20 14:17:40	+Ramereth	i mean, worst case we can remove the version I patched and use whatever upstream eventually uses right?

2014-05-21 11:00:34	+Ramereth	you might ask them in the irc channel which approach they prefer if we want to use havana

2014-05-21 15:43:04	armiller	their d6 site has a bug with a cache table growing. I made a cron job to truncate the table every hour

2014-05-22 09:12:24	lrr	Ramereth: also, i think the way you defined the networking might be causing at least part of the issue
2014-05-22 09:12:42	+Ramereth	that shouldn't be related to the libguestfs problem
2014-05-22 09:12:46	+Ramereth	but yes, I know there is something odd going on there
2014-05-22 09:12:48	lrr	for some reason the instance has 2 private ips, both of the same address
2014-05-22 09:12:57	+Ramereth	i can't remove the other network for some reason
2014-05-22 09:13:06	lrr	Ramereth: yeah, it's kinda wonky
2014-05-22 09:13:14	lrr	let me try a command that i recently found

2014-05-22 09:15:29	+Ramereth	i'm still confused how one of those ended up there

2014-05-22 09:19:00	lrr	this is a description of the network sutff
2014-05-22 09:19:17	lrr	for nova-network, we should only define 1 as it sets up the NAT network for the vms
2014-05-22 09:19:27	lrr	then we can (for now) manually manage the floating pool
2014-05-22 09:19:46	lrr	but the public part should probably be removed
2014-05-22 09:20:08	+Ramereth	you're not looking at the most current version of that file
2014-05-22 09:20:13	lrr	i just git pulled
2014-05-22 09:20:26	lrr	i only selected the part you labeled as private

2014-05-22 09:21:23	lrr	oh derp
2014-05-22 09:21:29	lrr	there was a vim .swp file
2014-05-22 09:21:48	+Ramereth	i still don't think this is related to the libguestfs problem
2014-05-22 09:21:54	+Ramereth	but it is a problem
2014-05-22 09:22:41	lrr	one thing i did notice: openpower1 only has 20GB of disk available?
2014-05-22 09:22:44	lrr	for instances
2014-05-22 09:23:00	+Ramereth	the vg is unused mostly
2014-05-22 09:23:06	+Ramereth	i was going to grow it later
2014-05-22 09:23:09	lrr	right now it shows used: 20GB of 19GB
2014-05-22 09:23:27	lrr	that culd also be an issue (i saw a traceback of a vm being too large for available disk)

2014-05-22 09:24:00	+Ramereth	it has 16GB free
2014-05-22 09:24:17	lrr	Ramereth: go to hypervisors of the admin panel on the webui
2014-05-22 09:24:31	lrr	openpower1 is only reporting 20GB of available space for instances
2014-05-22 09:24:34	lrr	er
2014-05-22 09:24:36	lrr	19Gb
2014-05-22 09:24:40	+Ramereth	strange
2014-05-22 09:24:40	lrr	and you're trying to deploy a 20GB vm
2014-05-22 09:24:53	+Ramereth	oh shoot
2014-05-22 09:25:03	lrr	which might explain the libguestfs error
2014-05-22 09:25:05	+Ramereth	ya
2014-05-22 09:25:13	+Ramereth	let me fix that flavor. didn't realize it was taht big
2014-05-22 09:25:54	+Ramereth	i have no idea how to remove that vm in there though
2014-05-22 09:26:27	lrr	i'm not sure either :\
2014-05-22 09:28:50	+Ramereth	i'm just going to blow away this anyways soon
2014-05-22 09:29:01	lrr	Ramereth: nova list shows no vm of any kind :\
2014-05-22 09:29:03	lrr	which is weird
2014-05-22 09:29:18	+Ramereth	so restarting the compute service on openpower1 seems to finallyr emove that other one
2014-05-22 09:29:23	lrr	ah
2014-05-22 09:30:14	+Ramereth	seems like its working (so far)
2014-05-22 09:31:13	lrr	also, we'll want the change the bridge interface from lo to the private nic
2014-05-22 09:31:14	+Ramereth	i grew the rootfs to account

2014-06-02 14:25:09	lrr	yeah
2014-06-02 14:25:17	+Ramereth	why are you adding the 140. route?
2014-06-02 14:26:30	lrr	i'm trying to have the nic connected the the 140. net handle the primary internet traffic
2014-06-02 14:26:42	+Ramereth	how are you doing it?
2014-06-02 14:26:42	lrr	which when I do that, all netwooking stops
2014-06-02 14:27:04	lrr	Ramereth: removing the gateway from the .bak nic, adding the correct gateway for the public nic, and restarting network
2014-06-02 14:27:13	+Ramereth	i thought we were going to have the boxes live in the backend network
2014-06-02 14:27:29	lrr	i don't think that's possible due to the api services
2014-06-02 14:27:29	+Ramereth	are you doing this via NM?
2014-06-02 14:28:00	+Ramereth	did you get the env working on the backend alone at least?
2014-06-02 14:28:24	+Ramereth	isn't the controller the only thing that needs to talk to the api service?
2014-06-02 14:29:51	+Ramereth	oh i forgot to tell you a few other minor problems I ran into specifically getting openstack going on on the power systems w/ chef
2014-06-02 14:30:02	+Ramereth	1) selinux needs to be disabled to permissive
2014-06-02 14:30:04	lrr	Ramereth: all the node have to be on the same management network from what I've seen (management being the api network)
2014-06-02 14:30:14	+Ramereth	2) you need to modprobe kvm_pr
2014-06-02 14:30:43	+Ramereth	3) i think the nova user needs to be added to the kvm group (or maybe that was libvirt)
2014-06-02 14:30:55	+Ramereth	^^ I think that can be fixed in the cookbook or env
2014-06-02 14:31:09	lrr	Ramereth: also i tried disabling NM (systemctl stop NetworkManager, then disable it) and enable network.service, but then networking jsut all together stops, even though it's getting IP and dns info
2014-06-02 14:31:25	+Ramereth	4) the libvirt socket needs to be 777 (but it shouldn't need to, i was too lazy to figure out what it needs to be owned by) might be related to #3
2014-06-02 14:31:56	+Ramereth	in my experience, its better to just deal with NM on the fedora boxes
2014-06-02 14:32:08	+Ramereth	i was using nmcli before (which is weird)
2014-06-02 14:32:22	lrr	yeah that's what I figured this morning
2014-06-02 14:32:30	lrr	just left it as NM and then networking works
2014-06-02 14:32:51	+Ramereth	were you having problems getting the api to work or something?
2014-06-02 14:33:01	+Ramereth	i had the selinux problems which prevented the nova-api to start
2014-06-02 14:33:10	+Ramereth	and then a few other misc permission issues I think
2014-06-02 14:33:51	+Ramereth	i think the cookbook might be adjusting the permissions/user/group settings incorrectly for fedora on some of that stuff using non-standard stuff
2014-06-02 14:35:05	+Ramereth	anyways, i need to get going
2014-06-02 14:35:08	+Ramereth	hopefully this helps a little
2014-06-02 14:35:17	lrr	yeah it does :)

2014-06-03 13:32:34	+pono	flask isn't actually a bad idea
2014-06-03 13:34:53	jnoah	edunham: there's reasons we won't have gwm all over again. :)
2014-06-03 13:35:05	jnoah	there're*
2014-06-03 13:35:44	edunham	jnoah: I'm just saying that refraining from building things on Django that shouldn't be is one such reason.
2014-06-03 13:36:51	jnoah	so long as premature optimization doesn't occur, all should be good :)
2014-06-03 13:47:37	lrr	pono: i just added a nic for backend, updated dns footers, and *only* added in ipaddr and netmask for the interface.

2014-06-03 14:29:26	muricula	are all the pdu's labeled in a machine parsable standard way?
2014-06-03 14:30:12	+pwnguin	maybe
2014-06-03 14:30:30	muricula	a promising answer
2014-06-03 14:31:56	+pwnguin	IMO, you should be able to depend on a list of hostnames
2014-06-03 14:32:25	+jordane	muricula: yes, they are.
2014-06-03 14:32:37	muricula	jordane: thanks
2014-06-03 14:32:44	+pwnguin	well, i mean, they should be, but i dont promise i set it up correctly in the place
2014-06-03 14:32:59	+pono	leel8on: https://support.osuosl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23919
2014-06-03 14:33:23	+jordane	muricula: they are pdu-b210-dell$racknumber.osuosl.oob
2014-06-03 14:34:52	+pono	leel8on: https://docs.osuosl.org/software/mysql/db_operations.html
2014-06-03 14:35:30	muricula	So if I want to know which outlet powers demeter.kernel.org, how can I find that out, jordane ?
2014-06-03 14:35:59	+jordane	muricula: heh, that is much more iffy. you log into the pdu for the rack it is in
2014-06-03 14:36:13	+jordane	and ask the pdu, but it has no real idea other than what people enter into it.
2014-06-03 14:36:23	+pwnguin	muricula: ive been documenting this in racktables
2014-06-03 14:36:36	+pwnguin	on the theory someone else can do the data entry / scripting later
2014-06-03 14:36:51	+jordane	muricula: https://docs.osuosl.org/hardware/pdu_management.html?highlight=pdu
2014-06-03 14:36:59	+jordane	login creds are in the firfile
2014-06-03 14:41:26	muricula	So one of the feature requests for the bit I'm writing is to be able to powercycle a server without knowing which outlets belong to it
2014-06-03 14:41:38	muricula	does that require racktables integration?
2014-06-03 14:43:27	+pwnguin	at the very least it requires the data be in the PDUs
2014-06-03 14:44:29	muricula	So would it require me to query racktables for what pdus are used and then use that to cycle the right outlets?
2014-06-03 14:44:41	+pwnguin	or something to move the data from racktables to the pdus

2014-06-03 14:51:26	+jordane	muricula: yeah, at the very least you need the rack number from racktables.
2014-06-03 14:52:46	+pwnguin	well, i mean, assuming every outlet:server mapping was uniquely identified
2014-06-03 14:52:51	+pwnguin	you could scan them all
2014-06-03 14:53:19	+jordane	because logging in to every pdu is nice and fast.
2014-06-03 14:53:20	+pwnguin	ie, all outlets tied to hyperion.asf.org were labelled hyperion
2014-06-03 14:53:35	+pwnguin	snmp is fast
2014-06-03 14:53:38	+pwnguin	comparatively
2014-06-03 14:53:59	+pwnguin	and this is trivially parallelizable

2014-06-04 13:17:24	bkero	We wanted to frame it and hang it here at the Mozilla PDX office.
2014-06-04 13:17:55	 *	pwnguin has never seen such a thing
2014-06-04 13:18:06	pwnguin	your best bet may be to inquire on the alumni mailing lis

2014-06-04 13:23:14	pwnguin	is that a building?
2014-06-04 13:23:19	limed	or maybe marineam or polvi has it

2014-06-04 13:24:59	+edunham	bkero: I just checked, and there's no blueprints in the bullpen or media room. But I did find a giant map of the kernel in an airmail tube addressed to cshields...
2014-06-04 13:27:19	bkero	edunham: I just had a thought -- it might be in the Mozilla Mountain View office, and that's where I remember seeing it.
2014-06-04 13:29:31	+edunham	ping Mythmon elsewhere and have him check?

2014-06-06 09:21:21	basic`	couple questions -- we're setting up a new monitoring server for drupal.org and wondering if we can get an snmp public string on the OSL/OSU NET public switch that has drupal.org equipment on it
2014-06-06 09:22:09	basic`	something like 'snmp-server community <random-string> RO'
2014-06-06 09:22:39	kennric	that I can't help with
2014-06-06 09:23:13	basic`	second, is it possible to update https://inventory2.osuosl.org/index.php?page=object&object_id=1591 with the backend switch configuration? like which server is plugged in to which port
2014-06-06 09:26:54	+bramwelt	basic`: #2 should be easy. #1 I have no clue about.
2014-06-06 09:27:16	basic`	bramwelt: someone with configure terminal access to the OSL switch can do that

2014-06-06 09:28:05	+bramwelt	oh, cool

2014-06-06 10:14:26	+jordane	pwnguin: hmm. that is odd.
2014-06-06 10:14:40	+jordane	I was going to do ds1 today, now that ds2 seems okay

2014-06-06 10:32:44	+lrr	Ramereth, just keep in mind, ubuntu is thwoing themselves at openstack, while debian is slow to react. the openstack support might be miles better in ubuntu

2014-06-06 11:02:04	+Ramereth	lrr: not to switch gears, but how much work would it be to get something like openpower4 setup to have public floating ips using the packstack setup?

2014-06-06 11:08:52	+Ramereth	actually, it might be easier to just do it on the public network completely (for packstack on openpower4) and just take out the .bak stuff completely

2014-06-06 12:00:57	+Ramereth	i have no idea
2014-06-06 12:01:11	+Ramereth	that may predate me. Does git log help?
2014-06-06 12:01:23	nnewton	it was last changed for BEAST
2014-06-06 12:01:41	nnewton	RC4 isn't really great anymore, but not sure who owns this. Just wanted to ask and see if we could just disable rc4
2014-06-06 12:02:13	+Ramereth	nnewton: as long as jordane or pwnguin sign off, I'm fine with it
2014-06-06 12:02:19	+Ramereth	if this is a global thing that is

2014-06-06 12:02:35	nnewton	seems like a waste
2014-06-06 12:02:47	+Ramereth	yup
2014-06-06 12:03:22	+Ramereth	jordane: ping. I think I'm ready to try the upgrade on a few hosts. Was going to do it on cherry first. Going to wait until the latest cfengine run finishes though since I need to push something out and I want to make sure I got it right. (i.e. shouldn't change anything)
2014-06-06 12:03:44	+jordane	sounds good. I'll be around
2014-06-06 12:03:47	+Ramereth	jordane: I think for this upgrade it might be best to do it manually instead of via cfengine. Maybe use it at the end as a catch-all
2014-06-06 12:03:58	+jordane	k
2014-06-06 12:04:11	+Ramereth	i'm seeing problems like conflicts with the version of neon installed. So you'll have to uninstall, then install (i built a binary for it)
2014-06-06 12:04:43	+Ramereth	then restart ssh/etc
2014-06-06 12:08:35	+Ramereth	jordane: i'll do cherry then fir next
2014-06-06 12:09:08	+jordane	alright. are you basically just emerge --unmerge; emerge $stuff?
2014-06-06 12:10:04	+Ramereth	basically. I do a test run, see what it says and then do that

2014-06-06 12:17:01	+Ramereth	so I guess I could upgrade those hosts too
2014-06-06 12:17:18	+jordane	makes sense
2014-06-06 12:17:21	+Ramereth	not a big deal though, just means it will get build manually if the use-flags don't match
2014-06-06 12:18:28	+jordane	right
2014-06-06 12:19:14	+Ramereth	ok, fir done. Moving onto larch
2014-06-06 12:21:58	+Ramereth	guess it needs to build on there since it doesn't need gmp. oh well
2014-06-06 12:23:22	+Ramereth	btw the i/o on hawthorn is horrible. I could never get it to finish doing an emerge dep graph just doing a pretend run
2014-06-06 12:23:54	+Ramereth	so looks like you need to do: emerge -C neon ; emerge -g openssl openssh neon  ... on the hosts that have neon

2014-06-06 16:31:40	+pwnguin	well, munin is worthless
2014-06-06 16:32:07	+Ramereth	why did it take me saying something to get someone to look?
2014-06-06 16:33:03	+lrr	i can ping openpower4.osuosl.oob, but i can't get ipmi commands to go through to openpower4 :\
2014-06-06 16:34:03	+pwnguin	Ramereth: well, one possible answer is that jordan is teaching the devs chef, and I wasn't paying close attention to IRC
2014-06-06 16:34:42	+Ramereth	lrr: goto the website that the .oob has and reboot the service processor (SP)
2014-06-06 16:34:47	+Ramereth	lrr: but don't do a factory reset...
2014-06-06 16:34:55	+Ramereth	lrr: should be the same password i think
2014-06-06 16:35:11	+Ramereth	pwnguin: students should be able to respond too if they see something
2014-06-06 16:35:29	+pwnguin	its friday at 4 on dead week
2014-06-06 16:35:32	+Ramereth	i'm curious why nobody seems to react when stuff comes up. Or at least say something on irc
2014-06-06 16:36:23	+Ramereth	it started sending alerts at 3:15pm
2014-06-06 16:37:27	+pwnguin	systers alerts pretty regularly, and resolves itself just as regularly
2014-06-06 16:38:12	+Ramereth	only because people let it go and don't react to it. I'd rather we look into why it does it and fixes instead of assuming it'll fix itself
2014-06-06 16:38:35	+Ramereth	we shouldn't get used to alerts. I realize we have quite a few that do happen. But this is one I don't think should be happening at all
2014-06-06 16:39:29	+lrr	Ramereth: what's the web address for it? openpower4.osuosl.oob isn't resolving on my laptop
2014-06-06 16:39:31	+pwnguin	fwiw, i can't log into systers console
2014-06-06 16:39:42	+Ramereth	lrr: use a full url with https://
2014-06-06 16:40:00	+Ramereth	pwnguin: probably because its swapping like hell because it was being ignored for so long
2014-06-06 16:40:11	+pwnguin	im getting password incorrect
2014-06-06 16:40:41	+pwnguin	well

2014-06-06 16:48:50	+pwnguin	its clearly not
2014-06-06 16:48:55	+Ramereth	we probably should regularly check those once in a while
2014-06-06 16:48:59	+Ramereth	not sure how that happened
2014-06-06 16:49:12	+pwnguin	yea, im hoping this wasn't our clients
2014-06-06 16:50:35	+pwnguin	now to figure out why munin has exactly 1 metric on this server
2014-06-06 16:51:03	+Ramereth	it does that when it can't connect to a client
2014-06-06 16:51:07	+Ramereth	the next run will bring it back
2014-06-06 16:51:21	+Ramereth	since the machine was swapping, it won't show the graphs it cant get
2014-06-06 16:52:07	+pwnguin	one would think it just shows no data for the time range =/
2014-06-06 16:52:57	+Ramereth	unfortunately, that's not how munin works
2014-06-06 16:53:05	+Ramereth	and i looked into it, its a 'feature'
2014-06-06 16:53:35	+pwnguin	oh, that's begging for a WONTFIX thread

2014-06-09 14:57:20	+Ramereth	it shouldn't be getting anything from funnel for one thing
2014-06-09 14:57:27	+pwnguin	or oak
2014-06-09 14:57:27	+Ramereth	where is eth1 plugged into?
2014-06-09 14:57:37	+Ramereth	i forgot those machines are setup slightly differently
2014-06-09 14:57:48	+pwnguin	not sure; we haven't annotated dell14 yet
2014-06-09 14:58:16	+Ramereth	i think its in that switch but its not on vlan42
2014-06-09 14:58:22	+Ramereth	which makes sense
2014-06-09 14:58:36	+Ramereth	you might temporarily hook it up to an adjacent switch to get it on vlan42
2014-06-09 14:58:43	+Ramereth	eth1 that is
2014-06-09 14:58:47	+pwnguin	sure
2014-06-09 14:58:55	+pwnguin	i think we have space free
2014-06-09 14:59:05	+pwnguin	is that gonna screw up when cfengine runs?
2014-06-09 14:59:17	+Ramereth	on what host?
2014-06-09 14:59:18	+pwnguin	well, i guess once cfengine runs, we can set it back

2014-06-09 14:59:27	+Ramereth	no, it shouldn't

2014-06-09 14:59:41	+Ramereth	but before you do a run, i'd like to double check the cfengine setup
2014-06-09 14:59:41	+pwnguin	true
2014-06-09 14:59:50	+Ramereth	you'll have to add the centos stuff for it
2014-06-09 14:59:53	+pwnguin	i'll work on getting pxe booting first

2014-06-09 15:30:48	+pwnguin	pxe wasn't enabled on eth1
2014-06-09 15:30:51	+pwnguin	but on eth0
2014-06-09 15:31:02	+Ramereth	pwnguin: oh right. i forgot to mention that
2014-06-09 15:31:10	+Ramereth	I usually disable it on all but the interface we want it on
2014-06-09 15:31:26	+pwnguin	i forget, do we normally want it on eth0
2014-06-09 15:32:24	+Ramereth	well, eth1 is usually on the backend which is currrently the only place we have pxe working
2014-06-09 15:32:28	+Ramereth	so for now, eth1 is preferred for pxe
2014-06-09 15:32:36	+pwnguin	just wondering why it was on eth0 then
2014-06-09 15:32:48	+Ramereth	I might have set it up that way first for some reason
2014-06-09 15:32:56	+Ramereth	well, i probably didn't use pxe boot
2014-06-09 15:33:06	+Ramereth	so the default is eth0

2014-06-10 10:40:31	+Ramereth	ok, then i wanted packstack on openpower4 and webui on there too as we know that works
2014-06-10 10:40:39	+Ramereth	but using public ips
2014-06-10 10:40:44	+Ramereth	for floating instead of backend
2014-06-10 10:41:10	+lrr	yeah, which means we need a working public IP on openpower4, which right now i can't ping openpower4 from anywhere outside of openpower4
2014-06-10 10:41:30	+Ramereth	so you are using routed networking for the instances?
2014-06-10 10:41:42	+lrr	not sure what you mean by that?
2014-06-10 10:41:55	+Ramereth	i.e. its not just attaching the vms to a bridge?
2014-06-10 10:42:06	+Ramereth	like we have on ganeti
2014-06-10 10:42:16	+Ramereth	we never set public ips on the public vlans on ganeti on the nodes
2014-06-10 10:42:32	+Ramereth	i guess I'm confused why we need it for openstack
2014-06-10 10:43:03	+lrr	well, openpower4 needs a public IP for the webui and the API services. you also need a public IP working so that you can use floating IPs on the same subnet as the interface you defined public IPs for
2014-06-10 10:43:21	+Ramereth	oh ok
2014-06-10 10:43:25	+Ramereth	then just put it all on public
2014-06-10 10:43:40	+Ramereth	i just want a working machine to hand over temporarily
2014-06-10 10:43:46	+Ramereth	that doesn't require backend access
2014-06-10 10:43:59	+Ramereth	that should be easy to do i would think
2014-06-10 10:44:00	+lrr	that's the largest issue i've been having. when I define the public networking, outbound network connmectivity stops
2014-06-10 10:44:16	+Ramereth	just remove the backend ip out of the equation
2014-06-10 10:44:27	+lrr	yeah, still the same issue
2014-06-10 10:44:32	+Ramereth	... how?
2014-06-10 10:44:33	+lrr	that's how it was setup over the weekend
2014-06-10 10:44:45	+Ramereth	i thought we had it working if public was the only one
2014-06-10 10:45:19	+lrr	no. if backend is the primary network connectivity interface, and public was a secondary, then network connectivity worked, and you could ping/ssh into the public IP
2014-06-10 10:45:42	+Ramereth	i am really confused now
2014-06-10 10:45:46	+lrr	i am too
2014-06-10 10:46:08	+Ramereth	i think you should step back and look at this from a simplier approach. We just want the machien using a public ip and that's it
2014-06-10 10:46:11	+Ramereth	it should work
2014-06-10 10:46:27	+Ramereth	maybe reinstall it and only use the public ip
2014-06-10 10:46:41	+Ramereth	anyways, i need to run to an appt and won't be back until after lunch
2014-06-10 10:46:47	+Ramereth	let me know where you end up before you leave for today
2014-06-10 10:47:38	+Ramereth	good luck!

2014-06-10 14:24:21	+Ramereth	no but they're not in production and will likely get rebuilt

2014-06-10 14:33:31	+Ramereth	hold on
2014-06-10 14:37:04	+Ramereth	ya, needed to remove it from the supercell2 root's known_hosts file
2014-06-10 14:37:06	+Ramereth	got it added
2014-06-10 14:37:10	+Ramereth	i'll work on fixing the instances
2014-06-10 14:41:31	+Ramereth	pwnguin: looks good for the most part. Thanks for getting that rebuilt!
2014-06-10 14:41:41	+Ramereth	you might add some docs on anything you ran into

2014-06-10 14:42:44	+pwnguin	i think vlan43 and the biosdevnames were the only two thus far
2014-06-10 14:43:09	+Ramereth	biosdevname is something we're going to hit on any new hardware with centos/fedora so its not just fedora
2014-06-10 14:46:15	+pwnguin	yep
2014-06-10 14:46:46	+pwnguin	im actually not clear why its required if we switched to the new nomenclature
2014-06-10 14:48:10	+Ramereth	we probably should eventually
2014-06-10 14:48:16	+Ramereth	but I'd prefer to keep it as-is for the ganeti stuff for now

2014-06-10 15:52:39	+Ramereth	actually nm, you can :)
2014-06-10 15:52:53	+Ramereth	you can just say that everything was reinstalled and the ssh keys should be installed that were in GWM
2014-06-10 15:53:04	+Ramereth	they all need os upgrades
2014-06-10 15:53:07	+Ramereth	or updates i should say
2014-06-10 15:53:24	+Ramereth	but aside from that they're all up but that one windows machine which I think is internal

2014-06-10 15:53:34	+jordane	manatee: is Ramereth just trying to make more machines run old versions of openssl?
2014-06-10 15:53:35	manatee	My sources say no.
2014-06-10 15:53:40	+jordane	That's good.
2014-06-10 15:53:40	+pwnguin	i believe windows was twisted
2014-06-10 15:53:53	+Ramereth	gwm has no owner so that means we did it manually
2014-06-10 15:54:29	+pwnguin	i believe twisted wanted windows7 for testing and pono put them on supercell
2014-06-10 15:57:14	+pwnguin	if they complain, we'll know for sure

2014-06-12 13:34:36	chance	i first need a centos box which has gcc and the build essentials so i can compile the wheels packages, i was trying to openstack yesterday with no such luck
2014-06-12 13:34:47	chance	and then i need access to put some directories on ftp
2014-06-12 13:36:10	+jordane	chance: any reason we can't just use the omnibus package that Ramereth and I built?
2014-06-12 13:36:22	chance	because this is for the setup.sh script
2014-06-12 13:36:24	chance	which our users will use
2014-06-12 13:36:28	chance	at least for now
2014-06-12 13:36:46	chance	and also something our setup.sh currently uses
2014-06-12 13:37:00	chance	if you want to use omnibus, then you should make a recipe for it in the cookbook
2014-06-12 13:37:18	chance	but since there are 0 docs on that in gwm right now, our users will still be using setup.sh and part of that includes providing wheels
2014-06-12 13:37:25	chance	which was the original part of the GSOC project for this
2014-06-12 13:37:53	+jordane	alright, well spin up a centos vm and build the wheels then.
2014-06-12 13:38:01	+jordane	install gcc and kernel-devel
2014-06-12 13:38:14	chance	i wasnt able to get vagrant to work
2014-06-12 13:38:19	chance	so i guess i just have to webui?
2014-06-12 13:38:24	+jordane	why not?

2014-06-12 13:39:22	+jordane	then just make a machine on http://otest1.osuosl.bak/dashboard/ directly.
2014-06-12 13:44:41	chance	alright, its almost done, what do i need to do for getting it on to the ftp site
2014-06-12 13:45:23	chance	it currently expects them to be at https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/osl/ganeti-webmgr
2014-06-12 13:45:32	+jordane	I'll handle that
2014-06-12 13:45:48	+jordane	rather, send in a ticket
2014-06-12 13:45:59	chance	okay
2014-06-12 13:46:00	+jordane	it's probably a good one for the new sysadmins
2014-06-12 13:46:06	chance	where can i put the data?
2014-06-12 13:46:09	chance	for them to access

2014-06-13 10:19:26	chance	i know i could probably get rid of the == true
2014-06-13 10:19:41	+jordane	lgtm
2014-06-13 10:19:52	chance	that part seems to work when i test with test-kitchen, but ive set that attribute on the node and it isnt making a difference.

2014-06-13 10:21:33	+jordane	chance: heh. you set the attribute to "true" not true
2014-06-13 10:21:40	+jordane	"true" != true
2014-06-13 10:21:42	chance	wait
2014-06-13 10:21:45	chance	its json though
2014-06-13 10:21:45	+Ramereth	well, that's an example..
2014-06-13 10:21:51	+jordane	chance: in json, true is true
2014-06-13 10:22:00	+jordane	and "true" != true

2014-06-13 10:22:36	chance	so ruby is bad
2014-06-13 10:22:39	chance	cause
2014-06-13 10:22:50	+lrr	Ramereth: does it actually require that? because most of the osl related vhosts on ash don't have the intermediate, and i'm not getting any ssl warnings in iceweasel
2014-06-13 10:22:52	chance	true and false as strings get converted in every other language ive used
2014-06-13 10:23:12	+Ramereth	lrr: they all have it. look at files/etc/apache2/modules.d/99_default_ssl_vhost.conf in cfengine
2014-06-13 10:23:19	+jordane	just because every other language does it doesn't make it right :)

2014-06-13 10:23:43	chance	:P
2014-06-13 10:23:54	+Ramereth	lrr: looks like the template needs to add that but only if you need it and a new attribute

2014-06-13 10:25:51	chance	thanks for the observation
2014-06-13 10:26:11	chance	one more thing, updating my cookbook, we were using knife spork to upload, right? the docs say to use berks to upload
2014-06-13 10:26:40	chance	it says to edit Berksfile.lock, update both locked_version and reviison fields
2014-06-13 10:26:40	+jordane	berks is for community cookbooks
2014-06-13 10:26:53	+jordane	i.e not ones you write

2014-06-13 10:28:38	+jordane	yep
2014-06-13 10:29:13	+pwnguin	so, if we want to set up streaming replication later, there's a tool to set that up post-hoc
2014-06-13 10:31:42	chance	ah, crap
2014-06-13 10:31:55	chance	oh thank goodness
2014-06-13 10:32:08	chance	i thought spork bump might have added and commited the change to the cookbook
2014-06-13 10:32:12	chance	(i already bumped the version)
2014-06-13 10:33:19	+jordane	ah. it only adds, doesn't commit
2014-06-13 10:33:34	chance	so, our chef-repo doesnt track the versions of our own cookbooks?
2014-06-13 10:34:48	+jordane	what do you mean?
2014-06-13 10:35:44	+jordane	btw, instead of { node[..][..] == true }, you should use {!!node[..][..]}
2014-06-13 10:35:47	chance	well, we upload our cookbooks to the chef server, and the cookbooks versions seem to only be tracked by the chef server
2014-06-13 10:36:02	+jordane	we also pin the cookbook versions in environments
2014-06-13 10:36:08	+jordane	which is the knife spork promote part
2014-06-13 10:36:11	chance	jordane: i could do that, but then everyone who is bad at ruby wouldnt know what that's doing :<
2014-06-13 10:36:20	+jordane	chance: add a comment
2014-06-13 10:36:26	+jordane	it's a pretty common rubyism
2014-06-13 10:36:39	chance	i like to write code that's clear enough to where you dont need a comment for something so simple :P
2014-06-13 10:36:50	+jordane	or not_if {attr.nil?}
2014-06-13 10:37:15	chance	nil? isnt right, false should eval as well
2014-06-13 10:38:08	+jordane	then use !!. That is the standard ruby method.
2014-06-13 10:40:18	chance	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7896/ what exactly is going on here?

2014-06-13 10:43:45	chance	but i cant be sure
2014-06-13 10:43:59	chance	it seems like things are segfaulting..but if i curl localhost then i get the right html response
2014-06-13 10:44:00	+Ramereth	chance: are you referring to the seg fault?

2014-06-13 10:49:19	+Ramereth	wrt those segfaults, my guess is python proc child processes from wsgi on apache
2014-06-13 10:49:23	+Ramereth	not apache itself
2014-06-13 10:49:31	chance	i just dont know if i should be doing that in a particular attribute, or in a recipe, or?
2014-06-13 10:50:32	+Ramereth	chance: you need to include osl-apache::default
2014-06-13 10:50:36	+Ramereth	that pulls in our firewall rule
2014-06-13 10:51:12	+Ramereth	i mean in the node rule list

2014-06-13 10:57:34	+Ramereth	is there any reason why we can't rebuild the vm as ganeti-staging?
2014-06-13 10:57:39	chance	no
2014-06-13 10:57:50	chance	need to update dns
2014-06-13 10:57:57	chance	and then update the node's hostname
2014-06-13 10:58:11	+Ramereth	i can do that. just let me know when I can take the vm down to do the renames
2014-06-13 10:58:18	+jordane	I can do it as well
2014-06-13 10:58:23	+Ramereth	jordane: i'll let you do it
2014-06-13 10:58:28	+jordane	k
2014-06-13 10:58:31	+Ramereth	would be good to do a completely clean rebuild from scratch
2014-06-13 10:58:43	+Ramereth	the dns for it is probably a forward pointer in maintain

2014-06-13 10:58:55	+Ramereth	just needs to be deleted and rename the hostname to that

2014-06-13 10:59:18	+jordane	it's just a pointer
2014-06-13 10:59:25	chance	i didnt get a cookbook for that, need to make an init script
2014-06-13 10:59:26	+Ramereth	jordane: hah ok :P
2014-06-13 10:59:38	+jordane	Ramereth: wait no. I can't type
2014-06-13 10:59:47	+jordane	it is a forward + reverse, but that is easy to fix.

2014-06-13 11:15:27	+Ramereth	well, i mean this ppc env
2014-06-13 11:17:11	+Ramereth	hmm, i bet you the firewall stuff will conflict with it ::(
2014-06-13 11:17:39	+lrr	yeah
2014-06-13 11:17:59	+Ramereth	that is goign to be problematic long term .. ugh
2014-06-13 11:18:28	+lrr	we'll just have to seperate out the firewall cookbook
2014-06-13 11:20:11	+Ramereth	so how would we add rules using the method that the openstack cookbook uses?
2014-06-13 11:20:54	+lrr	Ramereth: the cookbook doesn't do anything with iptables. the services themselves add the rules (and remove them when you stop the service)
2014-06-13 11:21:07	+lrr	the cookbook only installs iptables
2014-06-13 11:21:09	+Ramereth	is it still using firewalld?
2014-06-13 11:21:31	+lrr	Ramereth: no. i disabled firewalld and told openpower1 to use iptables
2014-06-13 11:23:35	+lrr	Ramereth: can you try openpower-openstack.o.o and see if you still get any ssl issues?

Write Ahead Log is roughly the same as binlogs.  /var/lib/pgsql/backups is where postgres archives WAL files when thinks it doesn't need them anymore for crash recovery / replication
2014-06-13 13:13:19	pwnguin	if we turn that off, it'll still keep some around and purge them as they expire, instead of archiving them

2014-06-13 13:21:03	+lrr	chance: well, there is a variable for the private key that i never pecified and so it's trying to use a different private key which isn't for openstack (at least for me)

2014-06-13 13:50:41	pwnguin	you could just set selinux to permissive

2014-06-13 13:54:06	chance	i fixed that
2014-06-13 13:54:37	chance	hmm maybe its taking forever because its timing out to all the ganeti clusters

2014-06-13 13:58:59	+jordane	hold on..
2014-06-13 13:59:23	chance	well, ganeti has backend ip's for its internal communication
2014-06-13 13:59:27	chance	this is the public HTTP ganeti API
2014-06-13 13:59:46	chance	which is probably restricted by to our backend network, but that isnt ganeti specific right?

2014-06-16 09:22:00	+chekkaa	it's a system limit on symlinks

2014-06-16 09:23:29	+Ramereth	chekkaa: by default rsync won't copy a directory if its on another filesystem (i.e. the -x flag enables it)
2014-06-16 09:23:43	+Ramereth	we typically don't want that enabled because of situations like this where we mount a large external volume
2014-06-16 09:23:45	+chekkaa	oh, that's what you mean

2014-06-16 10:29:27	pwnguin	shall we sacrifice these 3 servers to feed the beast until the migration is complete?
2014-06-16 10:30:20	+Ramereth	are the disks in those machines compatible? I'm fine with it but when was the last time we talked with the xen folks? I'd at least let them know we'll reclaim one of those

2014-06-16 11:09:45	pwnguin	jordane: should we just delete that node from chef?
2014-06-16 11:09:54	+jordane	and client too
2014-06-16 11:10:03	pwnguin	?
2014-06-16 11:10:31	+jordane	chef has both a node and client. Client is basically just the private/public keypair
2014-06-16 11:10:45	+jordane	clients should always be removed when nodes are.
2014-06-16 11:11:00	pwnguin	okay. and thats just removing a pubkey from chef server, yes?
2014-06-16 11:11:01	+Ramereth	i wondered what the difference was
2014-06-16 11:11:20	+jordane	clients can authenticate with the chef-server, nodes have run-time data.
2014-06-16 11:11:41	+jordane	an admin client can create other clients and upload/change things on the server.
2014-06-16 11:12:04	+jordane	so if you delete your client, the .pem in your ~/.chef will stop working.
2014-06-16 11:12:08	pwnguin	anyone know what sitkalder was for?
2014-06-16 11:12:14	pwnguin	'aka xen3'
2014-06-16 11:12:36	+Ramereth	it was an old xen node and an old db server too

2014-06-16 16:38:49	kennric	the interface is acting a bit weird
2014-06-16 16:41:12	kennric	nav menus are not working, at least on http://oc-test3.stg.orvsd.org
2014-06-16 16:42:30	kennric	and https has broken theme
2014-06-16 16:42:41	kennric	armiller ^
2014-06-16 16:44:13	+armiller	kennric: yea its the mixed ssl content warning issue
2014-06-16 16:45:25	kennric	do we have a fix for that?
2014-06-16 16:46:12	+armiller	in the config.php you can change $CFG->ssllogin to false
2014-06-16 16:46:29	+armiller	but it is failing to load javascript which is why the menus are broken
2014-06-16 16:46:39	kennric	hmm, ok

2014-06-16 16:58:41	Ramereth	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7941/
2014-06-16 16:58:57	Ramereth	we haven't locked any versions of cookbooks yet
2014-06-16 16:59:00	Ramereth	just an fyi
2014-06-16 16:59:05	Ramereth	so that might be part of it
2014-06-16 16:59:18	Ramereth	keep in mind this is the osl-openstack-ppc64-staging environment
2014-06-16 16:59:46	+armiller	Ramereth: thats probably it. Its will pull from the lastest if not defined in the env. I am sure those openstack cookbooks have specific requirements
2014-06-16 17:00:06	Ramereth	have we upgraded any community cookbooks recently?
2014-06-16 17:00:09	Ramereth	within the last week or so?
2014-06-16 17:00:19	+armiller	not that I know of.
2014-06-16 17:05:13	+armiller	looks like its the apt cookbook
2014-06-16 17:05:36	+armiller	try setting apt 2.4.0 in the env
2014-06-16 17:06:51	Ramereth	what in the world
2014-06-16 17:06:59	Ramereth	why is there no metadata.rb and a .json instead?
2014-06-16 17:07:44	+armiller	for?
2014-06-16 17:07:51	Ramereth	openstack-common
2014-06-16 17:08:34	+armiller	I don't see that cookbook in our org
2014-06-16 17:08:45	Ramereth	its not, its in stackforge
2014-06-16 17:08:59	Ramereth	https://github.com/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-common
2014-06-16 17:08:59	+armiller	I see a metadata.rb
2014-06-16 17:09:03	Ramereth	ya..
2014-06-16 17:09:12	Ramereth	i'm trying to figure out how that got munged
2014-06-16 17:09:30	Ramereth	my local copy has .rb
2014-06-16 17:10:10	Ramereth	i guess I can try uploading it again
2014-06-16 17:10:14	Ramereth	right?
2014-06-16 17:10:20	+armiller	sure
2014-06-16 17:10:30	Ramereth	should I remove it first?
2014-06-16 17:10:57	+armiller	Ramereth: ya. Did you run berks upload from the openstack common cookbook?
2014-06-16 17:11:24	Ramereth	no, i probably ran knife cookbook upload
2014-06-16 17:11:36	Ramereth	but I didn't originally upload this one
2014-06-16 17:11:39	Ramereth	i think lrr did
2014-06-16 17:11:39	+armiller	if you use berks upload you at least know that all the depends are on the chef server
2014-06-16 17:11:58	Ramereth	is there a dry run option for doing that?
2014-06-16 17:13:27	Ramereth	i'm going to use knife cookbook for this and see what happens
2014-06-16 17:14:02	+armiller	Ah. I got to get going.

2014-06-17 09:42:23	+mathuin	I added 'echo $PATH' to the script, and /usr/bin is in the path.  wget is in /usr/bin.

2014-06-17 10:10:41	+Ramereth	although the BSG said they had a few extras
2014-06-17 10:11:17	kennric	we should follow up on that, the bullpen chairs are mostly awful as well

2014-06-17 13:59:41	+Ramereth	hmm
2014-06-17 14:01:32	+Ramereth	its in a REALLY weird state
2014-06-17 14:01:37	+jordane	Yep..
2014-06-17 14:01:44	+Ramereth	what did you do exactly?
2014-06-17 14:02:27	+jordane	noticed it had a device in /dev/mapper, tried to kpartx it, realized that the drbd disks for ns1/2 were in a WFConnection/StandAlone state, tried to get them to connect back.

2014-06-17 14:10:56	+Ramereth	is it drbd9?

2014-06-17 14:20:04	+jordane	and running it manually was probably a terrible idea.

2014-06-17 16:41:24	mathuin	So the version of nginx installed by centos was released on 2012-04-12.  That's normal, right?
2014-06-17 16:41:43	+Ramereth	considering centos6 was released around then? probably
2014-06-17 16:41:49	+Ramereth	any features you need in a newer version?
2014-06-17 16:42:00	mathuin	No, I'm just concerned about doc drift.
2014-06-17 16:42:25	mathuin	If they still have the 1.0 docs available, basically.  Following the quickstart from the current version fails.
2014-06-17 16:42:39	mathuin	I really like how django does docs.
2014-06-17 16:42:52	+Ramereth	what are you try ing to do?
2014-06-17 16:43:16	mathuin	I just want to set up nginx to proxy 127.0.0.1:8001 to 127.0.0.1:80, actually.
2014-06-17 16:43:27	mathuin	They went and changed directives. :-)
2014-06-17 16:43:48	+Ramereth	you might chat with one of the systems guys to help you with that
2014-06-17 16:44:04	+Ramereth	they deal with nginx more and can probably point you in the right direction

2014-06-18 11:47:53	+Ramereth	ok, i'll work on that
2014-06-18 11:48:02	+Ramereth	just wanted to make sure we agreed on the implementation
2014-06-18 11:48:07	+jordane	right
2014-06-18 11:51:19	+Ramereth	the base role doesn't bring in the firewall right?
2014-06-18 11:51:44	+jordane	I don't think so.
2014-06-18 11:52:16	+Ramereth	... osl-munin does
2014-06-18 11:52:18	+Ramereth	which is in base
2014-06-18 11:52:19	+Ramereth	:(
2014-06-18 11:52:21	+pwnguin	i think it does
2014-06-18 11:52:29	+armiller	we can remove munin from base
2014-06-18 11:52:49	+pwnguin	well
2014-06-18 11:52:55	+Ramereth	before we do that, we should see what still needs munin
2014-06-18 11:53:04	+Ramereth	that's only in baes
2014-06-18 11:53:05	+Ramereth	*base
2014-06-18 11:53:22	+pwnguin	the only thing i know of in base but not managed is the goblin infra
2014-06-18 11:53:24	+jordane	ah, I missed osl-munin >.<
2014-06-18 11:53:44	+armiller	pwnguin: we can just add the osl-munin recipe to the role
2014-06-18 11:53:46	+pwnguin	and we probably want to keep that monitored
2014-06-18 11:53:50	+Ramereth	although at some point I'd like to figure out how to work around this firewall issue on the openstack compute side
2014-06-18 11:53:59	+pwnguin	are there other things in base?
2014-06-18 11:54:18	+pwnguin	i'm fine with moving it to the goblin roles
2014-06-18 11:54:25	+jordane	pwnguin: every node has the base role applied.
2014-06-18 11:54:31	+jordane	and most have base_managed as well.

2014-06-18 13:33:40	+jordane	it isn't really how chef is designed to do things.
2014-06-18 13:34:05	+jordane	since chef is a two-phase system, attributes are kind of odd in the compilation phase
2014-06-18 13:34:07	+Ramereth	i'm pretty sure attributes are used like that in the openstack chef cookbooks
2014-06-18 13:34:24	+jordane	so they can take on unexpected values before the compilation phase finishes
2014-06-18 13:34:42	+jordane	and recipes are included during the compilation phase
2014-06-18 13:36:02	+Ramereth	hmm ok
2014-06-18 13:36:15	+jordane	Basically there is no guarantee that the attribute has the same value during the compilation phase compared to the convergence phase.
2014-06-18 13:38:38	+Ramereth	what normally causes the unexpected values?
2014-06-18 13:38:50	+jordane	Assigning them in different places.
2014-06-18 13:39:09	+jordane	e.g a cookbook gives it a default of $x, but it is overriden to $y latler

2014-06-18 13:39:26	+jnoah	hey all. using nginx, how does one configure different ports for different sites? I have 3 moodle sites and TheOC. All should be at localhost. TheOC would be at port 80, the three moodle sites at 81, 82, and 83.
2014-06-18 13:40:22	+pono	jnoah: I read this to get acquainted with nginx, https://library.linode.com/web-servers/nginx/configuration/basic#sph_understanding-how-nginx-works

2014-06-18 13:40:41	+armiller	jnoah: do you still need help?
2014-06-18 13:41:00	kennric	thats a much more normal and standard way to do things, and you don't have port numbers floating around everywhere
2014-06-18 13:41:01	+jnoah	armiller: not with the original problem. new stuff with nginx has come up though
2014-06-18 13:41:43	+Ramereth	jordane: hmm. ok. Guess that makes sense. So that begs to question how do we deal with that in roles without makign it too complicated?
2014-06-18 13:42:15	+jordane	I'd prefer to slim down base to make it as simple as possible, and then everything else goes in base_managed
2014-06-18 13:42:27	+jnoah	kennric: i'm unsure how that'd work with a VM
2014-06-18 13:43:35	kennric	jnoah: set them up as normal on the vm, and put the vhosts in the hosts file
2014-06-18 13:44:07	+jordane	jnoah: so then you'd have 127.0.0.1 theoc\n127.0.0.1 someothervhost in /etc/hosts
2014-06-18 13:44:08	kennric	it is a little less self-contained, since you need the hosts entries, but dealing with multiple ports for different sites is going to be a pain

2014-06-18 14:10:59	+armiller	if you run berks install it should give you more detail
2014-06-18 14:13:35	+Ramereth	https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf-api/tree/master/cookbook <- seems like it wouldn't be hard to run one
2014-06-18 14:14:10	+jordane	Yeah, it is pretty easy. I played around with one on my workstation
2014-06-18 14:14:22	+jordane	I meant to get it running on our chef server, but then openssl called.
2014-06-18 14:14:28	+Ramereth	ah
2014-06-18 14:14:41	+Ramereth	what's the best short term solution?
2014-06-18 14:14:58	+jordane	You could set up an api locally, and point it to our chef server.
2014-06-18 14:15:03	+jordane	It is pretty easy
2014-06-18 14:15:11	+pono	Ramereth: Mind if I come bug you?
2014-06-18 14:15:27	+armiller	Ramereth: I just specified each cookbook path in the berksfile
2014-06-18 14:15:45	+Ramereth	pono: nope, go for it

2014-06-18 14:40:34	+jnoah	this causes the solution kennric suggested to be ... a bit more tricky, unless we modify the cookbook
2014-06-18 14:40:39	+jordane	jnoah: if you wanted, you could add entries to it in chef

2014-06-19 08:08:07	+mathuin	It appears to try six different keys before failing.
2014-06-19 08:08:16	+mathuin	I'm reading the man page to see if I can force it to use my osuosl key.
2014-06-19 08:09:14	+mathuin	Interesting, it should already be forced according to my .ssh/config -- Host *osuosl.org //   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/osuosl_id_rsa
2014-06-19 08:11:08	+mathuin	Destroyed my ssh-agent, restarted it with just the work key, it let me in.

2014-06-19 08:13:26	+mathuin	No, but I have a few keys (one for home, one for work, one for each of a couple of VPSen I use)

2014-06-19 08:58:04	+mathuin	If the issue is surprise unlocking, it might be due to your screensaver.  We have that happen a lot.

2014-06-19 08:58:41	+mathuin	Using vagrant with openstack lets me specify an "ssh_username", a user that is on the box that I can ssh into.  Is there a comparable setting for the virtualbox provider?
2014-06-19 08:59:07	+mathuin	I know I can ssh in as root, I'm hoping for a centos user, so my provisioning will be the same.
2014-06-19 09:00:15	+mathuin	It's possible that this could be a box-level issue and not a config-level issue but I thought I'd ask first.

2014-06-19 09:44:42	+Ramereth	that's a horrible choice for server long term
2014-06-19 09:44:44	+jordane	I was going to ask them, stuart didn't mention why.
2014-06-19 09:44:50	kennric	hinteresting...
2014-06-19 09:44:53	+Ramereth	i would strongly recommend they avoid it
2014-06-19 09:45:02	+Ramereth	kennric: if you're interested, I can walk you through how you would do it
2014-06-19 09:45:25	+Ramereth	kennric: there's the easy way that are jsut scripts outside of packer... the hard way of incorporating it in packer itself
2014-06-19 09:45:37	+Ramereth	its semi-specific to how instance-image works though
2014-06-19 09:45:52	kennric	sure
2014-06-19 09:46:04	+Ramereth	jordane: or I would put it this way, if they run into issues with it upgrading in the future, we can't spend a lot of time fixing it because we know its a bad decision
2014-06-19 09:48:22	+pwnguin	stuarta is a rhat employee, i guess we should be glad they didnt ask for rawhide
2014-06-19 09:48:55	+Ramereth	if they are willing to put up with maintaining upgrades and feel they can manage it, I don't have a problem
2014-06-19 09:49:20	+jordane	Yeah, that is more or less what I told him.
2014-06-19 09:49:21	+Ramereth	i think we may have one or two vms that are fedora
2014-06-19 09:49:30	+pwnguin	memcached1/2 are fedora

2014-06-19 09:50:19	+Ramereth	man, i really wish I knew why chiliproject always barfs on the time log reporting stuff to csv on a specific report I do
2014-06-19 09:51:00	+mathuin	Ramereth: I still haven't forgotten about PGD reporting :-)
2014-06-19 09:51:02	+pwnguin	without diving into the logs, i'm going to guess slow query log
2014-06-19 09:51:11	+mathuin	Was hoping to have something more specific to report on with this excitement.
2014-06-19 09:51:47	+Ramereth	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/8066/ <- so freaking annoying
2014-06-19 09:52:44	+pwnguin	i mean, that seems pretty straightforward
2014-06-19 09:53:42	+Ramereth	i assume this an easy bug to fix but surprised nobody has reported it AFAIK

2014-06-19 10:03:48	kennric	hmmm, strange to see h in a view, thats an erb template method, might just not be available in the view
2014-06-19 10:04:21	+Ramereth	this app is on hackberry if you want to take a look
2014-06-19 10:05:01	+Ramereth	i literally have to use copy/paste from the html page and import into a spreadsheet for my report currently
2014-06-19 10:05:03	+Ramereth	a PITA
2014-06-19 10:09:59	+Ramereth	mathuin: yes, I need those hours ASAP
2014-06-19 10:10:36	+pwnguin	kennric: maybe just add an import for ERB:Util?
2014-06-19 10:11:53	kennric	yeah, I think that is all it needs, the question is do we have a way to test changes? is there a testing or staging instance of code?
2014-06-19 10:12:41	+Ramereth	not really. But you can literally copy that whole directory to a vagrant vm, and then just export the db into a test db locally
2014-06-19 10:14:25	kennric	Ramereth: ok, will give that a try in a bit, can send me directions to reproduce the error?
2014-06-19 10:15:03	+Ramereth	kennric: might be easier to show you. Let me know once you have a local instance going and I can show you
2014-06-19 10:16:02	+Ramereth	so funny. the copy/paste trick works in firefox, but not chrome
2014-06-19 10:16:07	+Ramereth	doesn't format it properly
2014-06-19 10:22:22	kennric	hackberry is centos
2014-06-19 10:22:23	kennric	?
2014-06-19 10:22:29	+Ramereth	gentoo unfortunately
2014-06-19 10:22:35	+Ramereth	but centos should be fine testing
2014-06-19 10:22:53	+Ramereth	you'll just need to probably do a bundle install to get the deps
2014-06-19 10:22:58	kennric	assuming ruby versions line up
2014-06-19 10:23:16	kennric	yeah, it is going to require a bit of tinkering
2014-06-19 10:23:39	+Ramereth	rvm can probably help you with that

2014-06-19 10:27:41	+jordane	pono: is there a reason we are monitoring igor?
2014-06-19 10:27:58	 *	jordane assumes it will be rebooting a lot while testing ipmi
2014-06-19 10:28:06	+pono	It was bootstrapped
2014-06-19 10:28:10	+pono	No reason for it to be reporting though
2014-06-19 10:28:22	+pono	How should I disable that?
2014-06-19 10:28:54	+jordane	just have base, not base_managed.
2014-06-19 10:29:09	+jordane	it won't be monitored if nagios::client isn't in its run list
2014-06-19 10:29:33	+pono	If I change that now will it remove from nagios?  Or can I just manually remove nagios from the runlist?
2014-06-19 10:29:46	+jordane	it will remove it
2014-06-19 10:29:57	+jordane	and you can't remove nagios from the run list without removing the role
2014-06-19 10:30:00	+jordane	since the role includes nagios
2014-06-19 10:30:15	+pono	[nagios][enable]['false']
2014-06-19 10:30:17	+pono	:P
2014-06-19 10:30:23	+jordane	oh. that's handy too.
2014-06-19 10:30:29	+pono	I just made that up
2014-06-19 10:30:33	+jordane	ah.
2014-06-19 10:30:34	+pono	I don't think it's real
2014-06-19 10:30:36	+jordane	probably not.

2014-06-19 10:31:36	+pono	Problem is that's defined with a wave function
2014-06-19 10:31:53	+pono	It collapses whenever you look at it

2014-06-19 10:32:26	+Ramereth	jordane: i've been pondering that still... as long as use it correctly and only in one place. Will it be ok to do that?
2014-06-19 10:32:53	+jordane	okay to do what?
2014-06-19 10:32:57	+Ramereth	10:30 <+pono> [nagios][enable]['false']
2014-06-19 10:33:29	+jordane	Hmm. Maybe.
2014-06-19 10:33:30	+Ramereth	we should be defining that in ONE place IMO
2014-06-19 10:33:37	+jordane	I'd have to think about it.
2014-06-19 10:33:38	+Ramereth	if we're doing it in more than one, then we're doing something wrong
2014-06-19 10:33:41	+zubriske	hey, i want to add a new folder in cfengine. files/etc/cron.daily/ftp/ . I kinda doubt it will automatically do what I would want.
2014-06-19 10:33:55	+Ramereth	zubriske: what's the context? what are you trying to do?
2014-06-19 10:34:19	+zubriske	I am trying to get each of the ftp boxes to run a cron job.
2014-06-19 10:34:35	+Ramereth	what cronjob?
2014-06-19 10:34:40	+Ramereth	is there a ticket for this?
2014-06-19 10:34:46	+zubriske	yes.
2014-06-19 10:35:13	+zubriske	https://support.osuosl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23966
2014-06-19 10:35:59	+Ramereth	ok, that will need to be handled in a special way
2014-06-19 10:36:20	+Ramereth	what does your cronjob do? I'm not sure we want it do to anything on the ftp servers themselves
2014-06-19 10:36:27	+Ramereth	we copy all those logs off
2014-06-19 10:36:44	+zubriske	How often?
2014-06-19 10:36:53	+Ramereth	daily
2014-06-19 10:36:58	+Ramereth	often enough for this use case
2014-06-19 10:37:04	+zubriske	Yes.
2014-06-19 10:37:05	+Ramereth	we might already be doing ftp awstats stuff
2014-06-19 10:37:16	+Ramereth	are you doing awstats or pwiki?
2014-06-19 10:37:22	+Ramereth	or whatever its called
2014-06-19 10:37:33	+zubriske	piwik.
2014-06-19 10:37:34	+jordane	piwik
2014-06-19 10:38:20	+zubriske	If i don't have to play with ftp that is fine. So where should I grab these logs from?
2014-06-19 10:38:22	+Ramereth	where is that getting processed?
2014-06-19 10:38:31	+zubriske	web1
2014-06-19 10:40:30	+Ramereth	there's a glusterfs mount for it in archived. But I really don't want that mounted on web1. Also doesn't seem like a good idea to do processing on web1. We generally do all the processing on fir and then copy stuff out (at least for awstats)
2014-06-19 10:40:37	+Ramereth	not sure that would work with piwiki though
2014-06-19 10:42:26	+zubriske	I'll look into that. I had been using rsync to do transfers in similar use cases.
2014-06-19 10:43:15	+Ramereth	jordane: you know what i'm talking about? Think piwik can work like that?
2014-06-19 10:44:08	+zubriske	I think that the processing can be done on a machine other than the machine that hosts it.
2014-06-19 10:45:48	+Ramereth	i guess what i'm saying. I'd prefer to have it setup similar to how we do awstats if possible
2014-06-19 10:46:06	+Ramereth	the problem is fir is still gentoo
2014-06-19 10:46:13	+Ramereth	so that may cause a problem
2014-06-19 10:46:23	+jordane	Ramereth: sorry, was helping rtyler with db stuff.
2014-06-19 10:46:26	+Ramereth	np
2014-06-19 10:47:13	+zubriske	Piwik doesn't need much to do its log analyzing. Just a single python script.
2014-06-19 10:47:14	+jordane	yeah, fir would probably be best if it doesn't cause a huge headache.
2014-06-19 10:47:37	+Ramereth	i don't have a problem if fir mounted the archived folder
2014-06-19 10:47:42	+Ramereth	actually would be nice
2014-06-19 10:48:03	+Ramereth	it doesn't currently have glusterfs installed but that shouldn't be a problem since we have a binary package for it
2014-06-19 10:51:34	+jordane	yep, emerge -pg confirms it'll just use the binaries
2014-06-19 10:51:49	+Ramereth	i think adding it to the proper class in cfengine should be safe
2014-06-19 10:52:35	+jordane	zubriske: you want to add it to service_glusterfs_client
2014-06-19 10:53:51	+zubriske	I would be willing to do that. I don't what that entails though.
2014-06-19 10:53:56	+zubriske	know*
2014-06-19 10:54:06	+jordane	take a look at cfengine/inputs/cf.classes in the cfengine repo

2014-06-19 15:59:43	+jordane	Ramereth: node['platform_version'].to_i < 17 doesn't work?
2014-06-19 16:00:36	+jordane	what is the error?
2014-06-19 16:00:53	+Ramereth	there's no error. It includes yum-epel when it shouldn't
2014-06-19 16:01:01	+Ramereth	it should only include that if its fedora 17 and older
2014-06-19 16:01:05	+Ramereth	er 16 and older
2014-06-19 16:01:49	mathuin	lrr: any idea why my VM creation is now hanging?  Back to openstack, same m1.large size.
2014-06-19 16:01:50	+jordane	you want if
2014-06-19 16:01:59	+jordane	unless means "do this unless the following returns true'
2014-06-19 16:02:11	+jordane	or > 17
2014-06-19 16:02:44	+Ramereth	to me it reads: unless platform family is fedora AND platform version is less than 17, then do .. include
2014-06-19 16:03:01	+Ramereth	the latter should be false
2014-06-19 16:03:36	+jordane	Ramereth: right. unless the version is less than 17, do the following:
2014-06-19 16:03:40	mathuin	If it's fedora and under 17, then the unless fails, else the unless succeeds, I think.  Grouping around the two conditionals would be more explicit.
2014-06-19 16:04:12	+Ramereth	hmm, you might be true
2014-06-19 16:04:14	+jordane	Ramereth: unless executes on all conditions but true

2014-06-20 09:04:12	+Ramereth	so no upgrade was needed?
2014-06-20 09:04:16	kennric	their master seems to be a head of their stable, their stable is a bit olf
2014-06-20 09:04:17	kennric	old
2014-06-20 09:04:34	kennric	right, my fixed branch is a branch of stable
2014-06-20 09:05:34	+Ramereth	interesting, its been over a year since a release
2014-06-20 09:06:30	kennric	I haven't looked in depth at their master, but the diff is big, I don't really know what they are doing
2014-06-20 09:06:50	kennric	but it isn't git-flow
2014-06-20 09:06:53	+Ramereth	you probably should make sure your change works on the master branch. Its probably their dev branch
2014-06-20 09:07:48	kennric	I will - to submit a pull request, they want it off the master - but I wanted to figure out our short term strategy to get the fix in production
2014-06-20 09:08:09	+Ramereth	i'm fine using our checkout with your branch
2014-06-20 09:08:13	kennric	(they also have an unstable branch)

2014-06-20 09:37:49	+Ramereth	where should I include that? i'm only testing it in that one recipe for now
2014-06-20 09:38:07	+jordane	I typically put it in the test kitchen run list.

2014-06-20 10:57:57	+jordane	but otherwise no problems
2014-06-20 10:59:31	+Ramereth	well, the problem is that its in base_managed but not base but base has denyhosts

2014-06-20 11:39:02	armiller	Ramereth: I have seen that iptables error with every boostrap recently. It would makes sense to start iptables after the rules are applied and not before

2014-06-20 11:39:50	armiller	It may have to do with our centos6 image
2014-06-20 11:40:02	+Ramereth	on ganeti?
2014-06-20 11:40:11	+Ramereth	which image?
2014-06-20 11:41:29	armiller	Ramereth: When I did my testing I never included base_managed. I was just testing the firewall cookbook itself. You can try deploying a new vm and bootstrapping and see if you hit the same issue.
2014-06-20 11:42:15	armiller	but the last 2-3 vm's I have seen get bootstrap fail with the iptables start error. I checked the old base_managed recipes before we moved it to the role and firewall was included before base::iptables

2014-06-20 15:04:35	pwnguin	I was work on the Portland Public Schools moodle site and it seem to have just froze for our authenticated/ LDAP accounts. Could you please help?
2014-06-20 15:04:45	+jordane	yeah, looking
2014-06-20 15:06:30	+jordane	hmm. Is the pass in the firfile? I'm not seeing it
2014-06-20 15:06:41	pwnguin	it is
2014-06-20 15:07:28	pwnguin	looks like they're only active on php9
2014-06-20 15:10:11	pwnguin	it may be worth installing ldap tools on these for debugging
2014-06-20 15:11:27	+jordane	did you pull the ldap pass out of the db to test?
2014-06-20 15:11:35	pwnguin	not yet

2014-06-20 15:25:14	+jordane	Ramereth: yeah, it should be in the berksfile. Or you should set cookbooks_path
2014-06-20 15:25:36	+jordane	it's in the role you include in chef-zero, but you don't pull in the cookbook
2014-06-20 15:25:46	+jordane	but it isn't the base cookbook that depends on it, but the role
2014-06-20 15:25:55	+Ramereth	ah
2014-06-20 15:26:01	+jordane	pwnguin: yeah, there are tons of fastcgi errors for pps. seems irrelevant
2014-06-20 15:26:40	+jordane	pwnguin: I pulled out the ldap pass, it is on php9 in ~/pps for now

2014-06-20 15:41:01	pwnguin	because i dont have any creds

2014-06-20 15:43:22	pwnguin	given that we haven't found anything relevant in the logs
2014-06-20 15:43:48	pwnguin	i'm tempted to be all 'this is because you asked a webserver to re-encode video'
2014-06-20 15:44:21	+jordane	"There is a script located at /auth/ldap/cli/sync_users.php which will create or suspend/delete (see the setting above) all LDAP accounts automatically. This must be called from the command line, ideally once a day during a quiet time using exactly the same procedure as the standard cron job (so you will end up with two cron entries). It is important, however, to make sure that all of the above LDAP settings are working properly before you try
2014-06-20 15:45:11	+jordane	hmm. that setting is set to keep the user htough, not suspend or delete.
2014-06-20 15:46:11	+jordane	oh. intereseting. do you see the lack of paged results support on the ldap config page?
2014-06-20 15:46:22	+jordane	Apparently that means the php can't handle >1k users

2014-06-20 15:58:00	+jordane	we haven't actually been able to find anything in the logs, and people seem to be logging in regularly just fine
2014-06-20 15:58:01	+Ramereth	according to her, its a big problem. I guess they're doing some training thing next monday at 8 so they need it working then
2014-06-20 15:58:14	+Ramereth	she said something about it "freezing up"

2014-06-23 09:00:17	+Ramereth	i notice something else unrelated to fedora/ppc64 this weekend
2014-06-23 09:00:41	+Ramereth	ah i remember
2014-06-23 09:00:51	+Ramereth	i don't think base::iptables is needed anymore. iptables_ng takes care of that
2014-06-23 09:01:07	+Ramereth	i kept running into an issue with service iptables start would exit with code 6
2014-06-23 09:01:16	+Ramereth	once I took that out of base_managed all was good
2014-06-23 09:01:41	+jordane	ah, yeah. that one can go away.
2014-06-23 09:01:49	+Ramereth	mind if I remove that from the role?

2014-06-23 09:08:21	+Ramereth	i also played around with vagabond this weekend a little. Strange thing. Never got it to fully work
2014-06-23 09:09:25	+pono	Ramereth: What's that?
2014-06-23 09:09:46	+Ramereth	https://github.com/chrisroberts/vagabond
2014-06-23 09:09:56	+Ramereth	basically lets you do clusters with TK for testing interaction
2014-06-23 09:10:07	+Ramereth	but uses lxc (but not docker for some reason)
2014-06-23 09:10:19	+pono	Oh sweetness.
2014-06-23 09:10:24	+Ramereth	it doesn't work with ruby 2.x :(
2014-06-23 09:10:29	+Ramereth	so you can't use chef gem install
2014-06-23 09:10:30	+jordane	Ramereth: iirc TK doesn't have as much docker support, but has lxc support
2014-06-23 09:10:44	+Ramereth	jordane: there is a plugin for it, not sure how good it is
2014-06-23 09:10:45	+jordane	someone wrote a kitchen-lxc plugin before docker was really a thing
2014-06-23 09:12:02	+Ramereth	can i just go ahead and merge my nagios and base PR's?
2014-06-23 09:13:51	+Ramereth	jordane: ^
2014-06-23 09:14:17	+jordane	I'm just taking one  last glance at them
2014-06-23 09:14:26	+Ramereth	k, thanks
2014-06-23 09:16:38	+Ramereth	i also figured out my chef_mailhandler issue this weekend, but not sure how to fix it
2014-06-23 09:16:53	+Ramereth	i think the problem is the chef run happens before dns is working on the openstack vm
2014-06-23 09:16:53	+jordane	the nagios one should change apt < 2.3 to ~> 2.2
2014-06-23 09:16:57	+jordane	otherwise its good too
2014-06-23 09:17:00	+jordane	base one is good
2014-06-23 09:17:11	+jordane	Huh. Why is dns not working?
2014-06-23 09:17:25	+Ramereth	well, its working. I think its a race condition of some sort
2014-06-23 09:17:30	+Ramereth	doesn't happen on virtualbox
2014-06-23 09:17:37	+Ramereth	i saw it happen on centos on openstack and fedora
2014-06-23 09:18:02	+Ramereth	there was another cookbook that uses chef_gem (i can't remember which) and it happened on there
2014-06-23 09:18:16	+jordane	hmm. interesting.
2014-06-23 09:18:18	+Ramereth	I'm not sure if its an issue upstream with rubygems.org sucking or dns not resolving fast enough on the openstack vms
2014-06-23 09:18:23	+Ramereth	it was very transitant
2014-06-23 09:18:47	+jordane	rubygems is a pretty horrible upstream, fwiw
2014-06-23 09:18:56	+jordane	but it could also be something on our side

2014-06-23 09:22:08	+jordane	wait, so you're doing openstack through vagrant?
2014-06-23 09:22:42	+Ramereth	i'm only testing the basics
2014-06-23 09:22:55	+Ramereth	to make sure the base_managed/firewall rules work properly
2014-06-23 09:23:00	+jordane	right, but I mean are you using virtualbox or openstack on the backend?
2014-06-23 09:23:20	+Ramereth	this was mostly on openstack (yo dawg, I heard you like openstack. So lets do openstack inside of openstack!)
2014-06-23 09:23:31	+Ramereth	i'm not actually testing that vms get deployed, etc
2014-06-23 09:23:35	+Ramereth	that wouldn't work
2014-06-23 09:23:38	+jordane	only virtualbox/vmware are supported on kitchen-vagrant
2014-06-23 09:23:52	+Ramereth	i'm using kitchen-openstack
2014-06-23 09:24:18	+jordane	that config has no openstack driver config..
2014-06-23 09:24:31	+Ramereth	https://docs.osuosl.org/software/openstack/openstack_test_kitchen.html
2014-06-23 09:24:35	+Ramereth	that's because i'm doing this ^^
2014-06-23 09:25:19	+jordane	Ah. interesting. I'm not sure how I feel about doing that.
2014-06-23 09:25:24	+Ramereth	we can probably adapt our TK configs to work with either platform eventually. I noticed a few examples on some of the larger CB's like mysql
2014-06-23 09:25:50	+Ramereth	what issues are you concerned with?
2014-06-23 09:26:14	+jordane	It's entirely unobvious to someone looking at just the cookbook that someone else is testing it in a completely different manner.
2014-06-23 09:27:06	+Ramereth	fwiw I noticed this when I was looking around: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql/blob/master/.kitchen.cloud.yml
2014-06-23 09:27:31	+Ramereth	we might want to adapt that for our openstack env
2014-06-23 09:27:38	+jordane	yeah
2014-06-23 09:27:41	+Ramereth	at least the config would be included
2014-06-23 09:28:19	+Ramereth	i'm just not sure how they flip between the two
2014-06-23 09:30:39	+jordane	Yeah, I'm not sure either.
2014-06-23 09:31:22	+Ramereth	i've been playing around it with ti see what issues we'd run into. Plus its easier on my workstation
2014-06-23 09:31:31	+Ramereth	stuff like the chef mailhandler is the only thing I've run into so far
2014-06-23 09:31:47	+jordane	can you get it to happen on both openstack clusters?
2014-06-23 09:31:54	+Ramereth	i don't think so...
2014-06-23 09:32:01	+Ramereth	i was going to look into that more but I don't think you can
2014-06-23 09:32:21	+jordane	interesting
2014-06-23 09:33:24	+Ramereth	i'll play around with using env vars some more and including a config in the repo

2014-06-23 10:03:58	+Ramereth	i need to fully test it
2014-06-23 10:04:25	+Ramereth	we're several versions behind. I worry we may have an issue with GWM since we haven't been working against the latest version
2014-06-23 10:05:43	+pono	Oh yeah. Well, we can always make new nodes and just migrate everything off :P
2014-06-23 10:09:46	+Ramereth	jordane: why is the remote base version 1.3.7 but I don't see that in metadata.rb or a tag?
2014-06-23 10:10:04	+Ramereth	did someone push stuff out w/o committing it?

2014-06-23 10:12:18	+jordane	hmm. it doesn't look like there were any changes.
2014-06-23 10:12:43	+Ramereth	so what should I bump it to?
2014-06-23 10:13:46	+jordane	pono: ^ looks like you bumped base to 1.3.7 without pushing changes
2014-06-23 10:14:21	+pono	hmm, let me check

2014-06-23 10:16:01	pwnguin	Yep, I can ssh in, however I've no idea what you've set my password to,
2014-06-23 10:16:02	pwnguin	and I therefore cannot sudo to root to start moving stuff around :)
2014-06-23 10:16:04	pwnguin	""

2014-06-23 10:16:27	+jordane	I'll drop a comment

2014-06-23 10:29:23	+jordane	Ramereth: okay, bump to 1.3.8
2014-06-23 10:29:59	+jordane	pwnguin: final step: git init
2014-06-23 10:30:04	pwnguin	heh
2014-06-23 10:30:14	+Ramereth	jordane++ (on both counts)
2014-06-23 10:30:14	pwnguin	well, there's already git-svn
2014-06-23 10:30:32	pwnguin	so you probably want git init, then git-svn ;)
2014-06-23 10:30:33	+Ramereth	if you look at the first commits of our cfengine repo you'll see git-svn commits
2014-06-23 10:36:15	+Ramereth	ugh, the chef openstack stuff doesn't use the newer mysql cookbook so I can't fully test fedora in TK
2014-06-23 10:36:31	+Ramereth	the older CB doesn't have much support for fedora

2014-06-24 14:16:28	+Ramereth	did you set it up that way accidentally originally?

2014-06-24 14:52:47	pwnguin	Ramereth: i didn't really look into it much, it was mainly alan and trevor driving it
2014-06-24 14:56:11	pwnguin	after we saw emsearcy using it for their internal docs
2014-06-24 14:56:25	+Ramereth	might be worth looking into at some point just to compare

2014-06-24 16:08:57	+lrr	Ramereth: going back through the mozdev ticket, the guy is currently sitting at ~77GB of data synced off of mozdev. Moving their mysql stuff to our cluster, and probably around 75GB of space seems like it would work for them
2014-06-24 16:09:21	+lrr	(if the mysql databases are much larger, that could drop by quite a bit though)
2014-06-24 16:11:38	+Ramereth	have we dont a db dump from them yet at all to see what the size actually is?
2014-06-24 16:12:12	+lrr	Ramereth: i can try that now (not sure if the mysql db pass in the firfile is correct, also sending an email right now to see if we can narrow that down)

2014-06-24 16:34:44	pwnguin	well, thats not good, it persist across a reboot
2014-06-24 16:34:51	pwnguin	or it never rebooted
2014-06-24 16:35:51	+Ramereth	it never rebooted
2014-06-24 16:35:55	+Ramereth	you may need to do a hard reboot
2014-06-24 16:35:58	+Ramereth	its done that before

2014-06-25 14:41:59	chance	jordane: i mean like, make an environment which has a runlist of user created recipes for managing stuff maybe
2014-06-25 14:42:28	+jordane	chance: Yeah. That sounds messy.
2014-06-25 14:42:31	chance	whY?
2014-06-25 14:43:05	chance	there's stuff that gets installed to homedirs which might be nice to let a user manage using chef
2014-06-25 14:43:12	chance	like gnome-extensions as an example
2014-06-25 14:43:18	+jordane	Well, you'll now have every workstation writing to your homedirs every 30 minutes.
2014-06-25 14:43:20	chance	or rvm, ect.
2014-06-25 14:43:47	chance	well i guess thats a problem with using nfs mounted homes
2014-06-25 14:43:53	+jordane	And manging user stuff is the job of a user, not the system.
2014-06-25 14:43:59	chance	could restrict it to a specific node which only has access to homedirs
2014-06-25 14:44:24	+jordane	Why can't you manage your own configs?
2014-06-25 14:44:49	+jordane	heck, you could write a chef-solo cookbook to move all your configs around
2014-06-25 14:44:56	lrr	^^
2014-06-25 14:45:03	+jordane	but don't mix it with the system configurations.
2014-06-25 14:45:21	chance	are workstations considered that? seems like a good way to have things out of sync with the chef-repo
2014-06-25 14:45:25	+zubriske	Ramereth: what would be an intelligent way of removing RC4?
2014-06-25 14:45:41	chance	what if there are system packages you need to install for things as well
2014-06-25 14:45:55	+jordane	if there are system packages, then do it via the normal chef
2014-06-25 14:46:08	chance	so your saying id have to split half of a config with chef solo with chef server
2014-06-25 14:46:11	chance	sounds more messy
2014-06-25 14:46:37	+jordane	Nothing is as messy as user files strewn all over the place.
2014-06-25 14:46:47	chance	for my digital ocean stuff, i got chef set up on a few vpses, and my laptop, i have my shell configs, on all nodes, and other things on juts my laptop, works great. figured it could be extended
2014-06-25 14:47:18	chance	makes managing keys even easier
2014-06-25 14:47:29	+Ramereth	i don't think you understand the concept completely
2014-06-25 14:48:08	+Ramereth	even though you can do it, doesn't mean you should
2014-06-25 14:48:34	chance	depends on the use case, but yeah.
2014-06-25 14:48:46	chance	i understand that not everything should be managed
2014-06-25 14:49:09	pwnguin	chance: part of the problem is that there's a dozen workstations -- which node do you associate homedir configs with to not run a dozen times
2014-06-25 14:49:23	pwnguin	the other thing is, do i really want to be notified when your cookbook doesn't work?
2014-06-25 14:50:39	+jordane	^ no, no you don't.
2014-06-25 14:52:05	chance	valid, though i imagine you could filter fairly easily what things get alerted, or logged to places.
2014-06-25 14:52:22	chance	i know chef itself doesnt make splitting errors for specific things up all that easy though
2014-06-25 14:52:35	+jordane	Also, if your cookbook fails a chef run it will make everyone else grumpy.
2014-06-25 14:53:40	chance	yeah.
2014-06-25 15:11:25	+leel8on	jordane: did you say that you had already created the VM for the gnome-geolocation?
2014-06-25 15:11:42	+jordane	leel8on: yeah, I'm bringing it up now
2014-06-25 15:14:00	kennric	does anyone have a bit of time today to run the new version of GWM through its paces?

2014-06-25 15:43:38	+pono	When you have a chance later could you help us out?
2014-06-25 15:45:01	pwnguin	Jun 25 22:38:32 zeus.osuosl.org kernel: [31989903.579547] grsec: From 140.211.167.136: denied untrusted exec (due to file in world-writable directory) of /var/tmp/ffiQwhEpZ by /usr/sbin/apache2[apache2:20105] uid/euid:4006/4006 gid/egid:4009/4009, parent /usr/sbin/apache2[apache2:20014] uid/euid:0/0 gid/egid:0/0
2014-06-25 15:45:06	pwnguin	that one?
2014-06-25 15:50:30	pwnguin	The following are global functions in the cffi.verifier module:
2014-06-25 15:50:31	pwnguin	    set_tmpdir(dirname): sets the temporary directory to use instead of directory_containing_the_py_file/__pycache__. This is a global, so avoid it in production code.

2014-06-25 15:51:26	+pono	mathuin: ^^
2014-06-25 15:51:31	+mathuin	oooh!
2014-06-25 15:51:34	pwnguin	that is probably not vert helpful =/
2014-06-25 15:52:30	+mathuin	So we could perhaps create a tempdir in the normal tmpdir, set it not-world-writable, point the verifier at it, and try that?  Somehow?
2014-06-25 15:52:42	pwnguin	indeed
2014-06-25 15:53:05	pwnguin	from https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.6/
2014-06-25 15:53:45	pwnguin	well, bing is pretty bad at finding the latest version of that docs
2014-06-25 15:54:31	pop_n_fresh	jordane: We talked about it this morning, but is there anything I need to do for orvsd_central cookbook staging on py1 and/or py2?
2014-06-25 15:55:53	pwnguin	on the other hand, google brings up 0.3
2014-06-25 15:55:56	+jordane	pop_n_fresh: it ran fine on py1, so you only need to do more if the cookbook doesn't do everything you need now
2014-06-25 15:56:07	+jordane	pop_n_fresh: i'll get it running on py2 tomorrow morning
2014-06-25 15:57:07	kennric	jordane, pop_n_fresh are you saying orvsd-central is running now on py1?
2014-06-25 15:57:33	pop_n_fresh	jordane: Sounds good. As far as I know the version that worked on py1 is all we need for now.
2014-06-25 15:58:02	kennric	second question - what needs to be done to start using a production db for the app, rather than stagindb?

2014-06-25 15:59:50	pwnguin	LD_PRELOAD
2014-06-25 16:00:14	pwnguin	manatee: can we hear him shouting all the way over hear when jack reads that?
2014-06-25 16:00:14	manatee	It is certain.
2014-06-25 16:00:19	pwnguin	manatee: even over chance?
2014-06-25 16:00:19	manatee	Most likely not.
2014-06-25 16:02:55	pwnguin	mauthin: the idea being whenever it tries to file I/O to /var/tmp, you silently make it /var/tmp/pythonffi
2014-06-25 16:03:42	+Ramereth	grsec does not execute anything that is world writable
2014-06-25 16:03:47	+Ramereth	or any parent directory that is
2014-06-25 16:04:04	pwnguin	and ffi contravenes this
2014-06-25 16:09:51	+mathuin	Ramereth: so if we make /var/tmp/something-else and have the something-else not world writable, that won't matter, because /var/tmp/ is world-writable?
2014-06-25 16:10:24	chance	sysadmins: please test out http://ganeti-staging.osuosl.org/cluster/ganeti-test (avoid changing production clusters, this one is fine).
2014-06-25 16:10:44	chance	id like to actually release and merge the 0.11.0 changes before i leave
2014-06-25 16:10:49	chance	need more testing
2014-06-25 16:11:07	chance	Ramereth: ^

2014-06-25 16:13:12	chance	pwnguin: shouldnt be behind
2014-06-25 16:13:18	chance	unless you changed it a week ago
2014-06-25 16:13:23	chance	the db is a dump from prod
2014-06-25 16:13:26	pwnguin	or I never updated it
2014-06-25 16:13:56	pwnguin	bug report: vnc console doesn't work in firefox
2014-06-25 16:14:06	pwnguin	Must set host and port
2014-06-25 16:16:24	pwnguin	chance: where should i send my bug report to?
2014-06-25 16:16:46	chance	it might not be running, let me check
2014-06-25 16:17:05	chance	not running, still need an init script for it to be made
2014-06-25 16:18:05	chance	should be running now
2014-06-25 16:18:28	chance	urg
2014-06-25 16:18:39	kennric	chance: I asked tschuy to put the init script, when he had it done, into the docs for gwm as a reference, not sure if he has that done yet
2014-06-25 16:19:04	chance	also firewall is in the way.
2014-06-25 16:20:24	chance	well
2014-06-25 16:20:28	chance	iptables -F broke things
2014-06-25 16:20:50	pwnguin	that was a very bad idea
2014-06-25 16:21:06	chance	pretty sure i was supposed to run -P INPUT ACCEPT first
2014-06-25 16:21:10	chance	couldnt recall the order.
2014-06-25 16:21:20	pwnguin	service firewall stop takes it down in the proper order
2014-06-25 16:21:21	chance	was just using history
2014-06-25 16:21:35	chance	so how to fix firewalled off machine?
2014-06-25 16:21:38	chance	reboot from ganeti?
2014-06-25 16:22:40	pwnguin	should fix it, i dont think they do any firewall rule caching
2014-06-25 16:23:45	chance	lol
2014-06-25 16:23:47	chance	well
2014-06-25 16:23:49	chance	this is fun
2014-06-25 16:23:56	chance	i think its mad
2014-06-25 16:24:10	chance	i need an adult
2014-06-25 16:24:24	chance	maybe serial console from the node.
2014-06-25 16:24:33	pwnguin	that would work
2014-06-25 16:25:07	chance	although idk the login
2014-06-25 16:26:08	pwnguin	well
2014-06-25 16:26:14	pwnguin	i can't get into the console either
2014-06-25 16:26:40	chance	password isnt in firfile
2014-06-25 16:26:58	pwnguin	so this staging server
2014-06-25 16:27:08	pwnguin	what if i just pkilled the qemu process
2014-06-25 16:28:44	pwnguin	there, vnc works on it, amusingly
2014-06-25 16:28:58	chance	i couldnt get vnc to work
2014-06-25 16:29:04	chance	but prod runs some old stuff
2014-06-25 16:29:15	pwnguin	vnc vnc
2014-06-25 16:29:20	pwnguin	no gwm middleman
2014-06-25 16:29:28	chance	ah
2014-06-25 16:29:50	chance	im going to go ahead and login to the old staging
2014-06-25 16:29:55	chance	and figure out the iptables rules i need
2014-06-25 16:30:09	chance	oh its allow all
2014-06-25 16:30:16	pwnguin	well then
2014-06-25 16:30:32	pwnguin	but you're right, there's no root pw in ff
2014-06-25 16:31:42	chance	does this look right ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:843

2014-06-25 16:35:15	chance	you said you got in and i tried, and it worked
2014-06-25 16:35:36	pwnguin	probably chef, or maybe you weren't patient enough
2014-06-25 16:35:40	 *	chance shrugs
2014-06-25 16:35:55	pwnguin	gwm waits for the OS to shutdown before rebooting
2014-06-25 16:35:56	chance	well im back in
2014-06-25 16:36:13	chance	now i just need to figure out ip tables rules for gwm/vnc
2014-06-25 16:36:20	pwnguin	i think we're gonna add this to the firfile now
2014-06-25 16:40:09	chance	what chain should i add the rules to?
2014-06-25 16:40:22	chance	just INPUT or "IN_TCP" which is what i see on prod?
2014-06-25 16:41:11	chance	oh thats something that was created.
2014-06-25 16:44:40	chance	pwnguin: vnc should work now
2014-06-25 16:45:22	chance	until chef runs again..need to figure out how to add rules to chef
2014-06-25 16:45:56	chance	jordane: which attribute should i be adding iptables rules to?
2014-06-25 16:47:05	pwnguin	chance: what's the encrypt button do these days
2014-06-25 16:47:23	chance	encrypts the connection, but atm on staging there isnt any keys
2014-06-25 16:47:32	chance	and apache isnt set up with https
2014-06-25 16:48:26	chance	pwnguin: are you aware of which node attribute to add iptables rules to?
2014-06-25 16:48:33	pwnguin	depends
2014-06-25 16:51:11	pwnguin	armiller did a largish refactor
2014-06-25 16:51:26	chance	oh i think i understand it now
2014-06-25 16:51:47	pwnguin	you may need to make a new recipe
2014-06-25 16:52:21	+Ramereth	chance: you need a gwm recipe in our firewall cookbook and then include it in the cookbook
2014-06-25 16:52:26	+Ramereth	although that's very site specific to us
2014-06-25 16:52:36	chance	cant i just add it to the node attributes like all the others?
2014-06-25 16:52:51	+Ramereth	typically what we do is use a community cookbook (like yours) and then make an osl-gwm cookbook with osl site specific stuff (like firewall rules)
2014-06-25 16:52:52	chance	i mean a recipe would also work
2014-06-25 16:53:17	chance	but for now, im just trying to get staging working
2014-06-25 16:53:18	chance	to test
2014-06-25 16:53:19	+Ramereth	but I don't think we need very many osl specific things for the gwm stuff. So we might be able to do this in a role
2014-06-25 16:53:24	chance	i only have a few days here left.
2014-06-25 16:53:31	+Ramereth	then just do service firewall stop
2014-06-25 16:53:42	+Ramereth	we can fix this tomorrow properly
2014-06-25 16:53:53	pwnguin	chance: the firewall recipes are very short
2014-06-25 16:53:55	+Ramereth	pono: unfortunatley yes, thus why I said the parent counts
2014-06-25 16:54:03	+Ramereth	pwnguin: did jordane already leave for the day?
2014-06-25 16:54:06	pwnguin	yep
2014-06-25 16:54:08	pwnguin	and tomorrow
2014-06-25 16:54:12	+Ramereth	right
2014-06-25 16:54:15	chance	atm i added 'vnc' to the node["chains"]["filter"] attribute
2014-06-25 16:54:26	+Ramereth	chance: no
2014-06-25 16:54:27	+Ramereth	don't do that
2014-06-25 16:54:35	chance	and i added -A INPUT --jump VNC
2014-06-25 16:54:38	+Ramereth	no
2014-06-25 16:54:38	chance	err vnc

2014-06-25 16:54:50	+Ramereth	you're jumping the gun here
2014-06-25 16:55:03	chance	its a staging server, i figure the worst that happens is it breaks
2014-06-25 16:55:05	+Ramereth	we need a recipe and an attribute in our firewall cookbook
2014-06-25 16:55:14	chance	i don thave time for that.
2014-06-25 16:55:15	+Ramereth	and then add that recipe to the run list
2014-06-25 16:55:20	+Ramereth	are you here tomorrow?
2014-06-25 16:55:33	chance	for a few hours
2014-06-25 16:55:36	+Ramereth	what ports do you need open?
2014-06-25 16:55:53	chance	843, 8888, 5800:5900
2014-06-25 16:55:59	chance	i tested it manually using iptables on the node
2014-06-25 16:56:01	chance	worked.
2014-06-25 16:56:26	chance	i just want the node testable by you guys so if i dont have much time tomorrow and friday it will be usable
2014-06-25 16:56:36	+Ramereth	let me add a recipe right now to the cookbook and get it going
2014-06-25 16:56:46	chance	and so that tschey can actually test his init script
2014-06-25 16:56:49	chance	for tvap

2014-06-26 10:31:05	armiller	btw has anyone looked into setting nagios pages to only alert once and not every 5min?
2014-06-26 10:31:19	+pono	armiller: Obviously not :P
2014-06-26 10:31:49	+pono	I feel like it should be logarithmic, so that it's 5 minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes, etc
2014-06-26 10:31:55	+pono	Because once can get lost
2014-06-26 10:34:03	+Ramereth	armiller: yes, why?
2014-06-26 10:34:43	pwnguin	armiller: I assume you mean in chef, because the cfengine managed nagios does that already
2014-06-26 10:34:57	armiller	I just keep seeing walls of alerts everytime I check chat. I was going to look into it a long time ago but other things took priority
2014-06-26 10:35:21	armiller	plus drupal gets spammed evertime something goes down
2014-06-26 10:43:14	armiller	pwnguin: yes, only chef nagios.
2014-06-26 10:45:58	+Ramereth	it should be a global setting. ill look it up

2014-06-26 10:51:37	+Ramereth	we put that in a host/service template and set it to zero and import it everywhere
2014-06-26 10:51:44	+Ramereth	not sure how the chef implementation does that
2014-06-26 10:52:01	+Ramereth	"This directive is used to define the number of "time units" to wait before re-notifying a contact that this service is still down or unreachable. Unless you've changed the interval_length directive from the default value of 60, this number will mean minutes. If you set this value to 0, Nagios will not re-notify contacts about problems for this host - only one problem notification will be sent out.
2014-06-26 10:53:11	+Ramereth	jordane: heya, did you see my question from last night about the firewall cb?
2014-06-26 10:54:36	+jordane	Ramereth: ah, missed that. Let me take a look.
2014-06-26 10:55:15	+Ramereth	armiller: looks like its an attribute in the nagios CB so should be easily modified

2014-06-26 10:56:05	+Ramereth	also not sure how I got - and _ mixed. I copy/pasted that code from the openstack recipe
2014-06-26 10:56:27	+Ramereth	ha, it does the same thing
2014-06-26 10:56:35	+Ramereth	so we can blame lrr ;)
2014-06-26 10:56:56	+jordane	heh. I do it all the time too.

2014-06-26 10:59:17	+Ramereth	 can I push out roles before recipes exist in CB's? I wanted to push out the gwm role I made but let you clean it up
2014-06-26 10:59:35	+Ramereth	has it been our standard to not include base_managed in a role usually?
2014-06-26 11:00:58	+jordane	if it directly needs something from base_managed, I'm fine with that
2014-06-26 11:01:03	+jordane	otherwise leave it for node data
2014-06-26 11:01:10	+Ramereth	k
2014-06-26 11:01:20	+jordane	I'd rather not have roles out that have nonexisting recipes

2014-06-26 11:01:56	+Ramereth	well, I'm just waiting on the PR to get pushed and hand over the rest to you :)
2014-06-26 11:02:16	+Ramereth	I'll just go ahead and push it for now and let you clean it up so we can get ganeti-staging working
2014-06-26 11:02:25	+Ramereth	i noticed it was using the _default env too
2014-06-26 11:02:37	+jordane	that's odd

2014-06-26 13:28:42	+Ramereth	that's a good question
2014-06-26 13:30:10	+Ramereth	I would word in a way that we've discussed this internally, and given our experience we don't think its the best approach to go with FreeBSD. Given that the current server doesn't use any FBSD specific features, it should not be difficult to migrate to Linux on CentOS
2014-06-26 13:30:39	+Ramereth	and then talk about that we can only support Linux and can not support FBSD if they run into any issue
2014-06-26 13:31:02	+Ramereth	But angle it around our experience determining this route as being the best approach long term
2014-06-26 13:31:10	+lrr	ok
2014-06-26 13:31:58	+Ramereth	and the fact that using FBSD adds nothing other than no support from us

2014-06-27 10:12:07	+mathuin	I was looking at gwm's repo on code.o.o and the settings.py.dist has a valid SECRET_KEY value.
2014-06-27 10:12:16	+mathuin	I wanted to know whether that key was the same one we use in production.
2014-06-27 10:14:05	+pwnguin	... sigh
2014-06-27 10:14:37	+pwnguin	you're the first dev to catch this it seems
2014-06-27 10:15:37	+pwnguin	iirc, that's for sessions
2014-06-27 10:15:45	kennric	our repo has always had a key in the config file, it is meant to be an example and changed when you actually deploy
2014-06-27 10:15:46	+pwnguin	so we can change it without trouble
2014-06-27 10:16:07	+pwnguin	kennric: well, none of the people who've ever deployed at OSL seem to have realized this
2014-06-27 10:16:53	+pwnguin	I take that back, it's for more than sessions
2014-06-27 10:16:57	+pwnguin	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7382149/django-secret-key
2014-06-27 10:16:57	manatee	pwnguin's tiny URL is http://bit.ly/1qPXJGy
2014-06-27 10:17:04	kennric	honestly it could be auto-generated on deploy by chef... but anyway, it is trivial to change
2014-06-27 10:17:21	+pwnguin	if by trivial you mean 'everyone needs to reset their passwords'
2014-06-27 10:19:09	+pwnguin	well, okay, it turns out it's not so bad; the only bit of auth that use is is for generating password resets
2014-06-27 10:19:24	+pwnguin	http://stackoverflow.com/a/15383766/9947
2014-06-27 10:19:46	+mathuin	That answer is based on 1.5, if we're on 1.6, things may have changed.
2014-06-27 10:20:10	+mathuin	And being able to hack the cross-site key is probably the biggest vulnerability I can see here.
2014-06-27 10:22:01	kennric	chance's config system for 0.11 generates a secret key, or reads and existing one from a local secret directory (with no defaults)
2014-06-27 10:22:51	+mathuin	Okay, if that's what we're on, then we don't really need to worry, as long as that key is different than the one in the repo.
2014-06-27 10:23:41	kennric	production is 0.10.2
2014-06-27 10:23:42	+pwnguin	0.11 is on staging
2014-06-27 10:23:51	+mathuin	Okay, so we're almost secure.
2014-06-27 10:23:57	kennric	and does not have the secrets autogeneration
2014-06-27 10:24:45	kennric	well, the quesiton is, has someone's session been snooped in the past to the extent that someone may have stolen credentials
2014-06-27 10:25:13	kennric	and can we confirm that the actual secret key being used in production is indeed the one provided by default and in git?
2014-06-27 10:25:23	+pwnguin	afaict, thats not an option of having the secret key

2014-06-27 11:36:06	+pwnguin	if i had to guess, because they just noticed three days ago
2014-06-27 11:36:21	+jordane	heh
2014-06-27 11:36:54	+pwnguin	change pushed
2014-06-27 11:42:41	+pwnguin	as best i can tell, that restriction is in place for performance reasons
2014-06-27 11:43:38	+jordane	It's there because it isn't a well defined behavior. If you look up a MX record for a CNAME, should it be the MX record of the original domain, or the domain that the CNAME points to?
2014-06-27 11:44:18	+pwnguin	the rfc doesn't mention that ambiguity
2014-06-27 11:44:23	+pwnguin	you could say 'both'
2014-06-27 11:44:52	+jordane	yeah, CNAME's aren't very well defined.
2014-06-27 11:44:55	+jordane	CNAMEs*
2014-06-27 11:45:15	+jordane	the RFC also doesn't specify who is responsible for resolving a >1 depth CNAME chain
2014-06-27 11:51:28	+pwnguin	Ramereth: I think it's resolved now, but I'd need amy's confirmation to be certain
2014-06-27 12:20:48	+jordane	zubriske: https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/ should be of some help
2014-06-27 12:21:06	+jordane	zubriske: http://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-disable-weak-ciphers-and-ssl-2.0-in-apache.html is also helpful

2014-06-27 12:38:12	+pruittt	jordane: looking into the templating issue with cgcc. Only permission difference I can find is settings.php has rw in dingo, but in their live site it's r only.
2014-06-27 12:38:17	+pruittt	I doubt that comes into play.
2014-06-27 12:38:32	+pruittt	Would purging cache tables in the DB do much you think?
2014-06-27 12:38:54	+jnoah	jordane: how does one run a specific recipe in a cookbook when deploying? The default deploys our prod/staging stuff, though we have a dev recipe that needs to be run for the workstations.
2014-06-27 12:39:27	+jordane	jnoah: add "recipe[cookbook::recipe]" to the run list
2014-06-27 12:39:39	 *	jnoah facepalms
2014-06-27 12:39:40	+jordane	and remove "recipe[cookbook]" or "recipe[cookbook::default]"
2014-06-27 12:39:45	+jnoah	Thanks, easier than I thought

2014-06-27 12:47:28	+pruittt	fun, looks like cgcc-test.osuosl.org is hardcoded in some CSS
2014-06-27 12:47:32	+pruittt	May be related =P
2014-06-27 12:50:06	+pruittt	jordane: Making a backup of the css dir and doing a find replace sound like a sane solution?
2014-06-27 12:50:54	+jordane	pruittt: sed has an option to backup any file it changes :)
2014-06-27 12:51:07	+jordane	pruittt: sed -i '.bak' 's///' files
2014-06-27 12:51:10	+pruittt	money, thank you sir
2014-06-27 12:51:28	+jordane	double check the man page, but I think that is the incantation
2014-06-27 12:51:34	+pruittt	looking now
2014-06-27 12:51:36	+jordane	I know it is the right one for bsd sed
2014-06-27 12:55:36	+pruittt	That was close =) sed -i.bak did the trick
2014-06-27 12:55:45	+jordane	aha
2014-06-27 12:55:50	+pruittt	However the themes are still not showing up =/
2014-06-27 12:57:25	+jordane	looks like there are some references to cgcc.us
2014-06-27 12:57:49	+pruittt	those shouldn't have broken with the dir change though, correct?
2014-06-27 12:58:03	+jordane	Nope. Danny mentioned in the ticket it was broken already
2014-06-27 12:59:07	+pruittt	Same request? I'm not seeing him mention anything about it until I brought up it was busted lol
2014-06-27 13:04:18	+jordane	Ah, I misread his email.
2014-06-27 13:04:26	+pruittt	whew
2014-06-27 13:04:37	+pruittt	I did find a few files via grep that sed apparently skipped
2014-06-27 13:04:44	+pruittt	So figuring that one out atm =)
2014-06-27 13:05:51	+jordane	kk
2014-06-27 13:11:10	+pruittt	derp, global replace instead of the first instance
2014-06-27 13:11:43	+Ramereth	what's this dingo site about?
2014-06-27 13:12:07	+pruittt	Changing the CGCC's test page from having it's own FQDN to being a sub domain of CGCC.edu
2014-06-27 13:12:21	+Ramereth	but why that name?
2014-06-27 13:12:30	+pwnguin	client requested it
2014-06-27 13:12:30	+jordane	cgcc requested it
2014-06-27 13:12:34	+Ramereth	ah. strange
2014-06-27 13:13:03	+zubriske	Yeah i thought pruittt was screwing around when I first saw it.
2014-06-27 13:13:16	+pruittt	Lol

2014-06-27 13:14:56	+Ramereth	we should document that in a comment somewhere then
2014-06-27 13:15:01	+Ramereth	otherwise we won't know what the heck it is
2014-06-27 13:15:06	+pruittt	Lol, will do
2014-06-27 13:15:15	+pruittt	What seems like a logical place for that note, outside of RT?
2014-06-27 13:15:19	+pwnguin	i mean, i found this out by reading the ticket ;)
2014-06-27 13:15:23	+pwnguin	so it's already in the ticket
2014-06-27 13:15:32	+mathuin	Do tickets persist after being closed?
2014-06-27 13:15:35	+pwnguin	they do
2014-06-27 13:15:43	+mathuin	Might be worth linking the ticket then.
2014-06-27 13:16:01	+pwnguin	oh, you mean a comment in the config file, not RT
2014-06-27 13:16:07	+Ramereth	pwnguin: but is the commit referenced in the git update for it? How will we know that ticket is the one? I guess we can always search for "dingo" but trying to reduce a step...
2014-06-27 13:16:12	+Ramereth	knowing how stuff like this works
2014-06-27 13:16:16	+Ramereth	pwnguin: yes
2014-06-27 13:16:30	+Ramereth	is this in chef now? i can't remember
2014-06-27 13:16:33	+Ramereth	whatever makes sense
2014-06-27 13:16:37	+pwnguin	Don't believe so
2014-06-27 13:17:02	+jordane	Not in chef yet
2014-06-27 13:17:13	+jordane	pono did migrate it to mysql1 on the db side thouogh
2014-06-27 13:18:43	pono	jordane: I didn't do anything with cgcc, it was already on mysql1
2014-06-27 13:19:01	+jordane	pono: oh, I thought you did
2014-06-27 13:19:05	 *	jordane shrugs
2014-06-27 13:19:23	+jordane	oh, that was occc and tbcc
2014-06-27 13:19:41	+pruittt	Man, this drupal page is fronting me something fierce. I've updated all references to the old domain I can hunt down
2014-06-27 13:19:46	+pruittt	Still no CSS magic =/
2014-06-27 13:19:48	pono	Yeah, cgcc was moved a long while ago.
2014-06-27 13:22:31	+pwnguin	I believe we migrated cgcc back when they wanted an upgrade last summer
2014-06-27 13:22:40	+pwnguin	and moved to mysql1 as part of that
2014-06-27 13:23:31	+jordane	pruittt: the css files still contain references to cgcc.us
2014-06-27 13:23:42	+jordane	which is odd
2014-06-27 13:23:59	+zubriske	here are my changes for the RC4 fix. Someone ought to review them. http://pastebin.osuosl.org/8346/90055614/
2014-06-27 13:25:35	+pwnguin	zubriske: do you have a vm test of this?
2014-06-27 13:25:41	+pwnguin	i'm curious what set of ciphers remains after
2014-06-27 13:26:15	+zubriske	nope. I have no test of this. Ramereth said I ought to bother him about making one.
2014-06-27 13:26:21	+pwnguin	i'll help you on that
2014-06-27 13:26:41	+pwnguin	since we mostly did it before that meeting anyways
2014-06-27 13:28:10	+pruittt	jordane: Probably a silly question, why would I want to update cgcc.us if I was modifying a different folder under sites?
2014-06-27 13:28:18	+pruittt	Shouldn't that still be a valid location to find files?
2014-06-27 13:28:26	+jordane	pruittt: should be, but odd.
2014-06-27 13:28:29	+pruittt	Or is there some drupal shenanigans I'm not getting
2014-06-27 13:28:31	+pruittt	Okay
2014-06-27 13:28:35	+jordane	something worth noting
2014-06-27 13:39:42	kennric	btw, a while back I found that my thunderbird had stopped being able to connect to imap.osuosl - the condition still persists, any ideas?
