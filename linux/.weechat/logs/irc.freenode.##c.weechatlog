2014-05-07 22:47:07	Zhivago	And the inability to spell "you" detects another moron.

2014-05-07 22:47:49	ESphynx	muricula: you try to write at memory where the pointer is and you see if your app crashes
2014-05-07 22:48:36	jack_rabbit	bad advice. :P
2014-05-07 22:49:29	pwnz0r	Its funny how trying to help other people / trying to ask for help qualifies you as a moron these days.
2014-05-07 22:49:32	ESphynx	muricula: you could write your own malloc implementation and then add query functions to it, it could be useful for debugging purposes, but it would be very bad for an application to rely on such a functionality :)
2014-05-07 22:50:13	jack_rabbit	muricula, as far as I know, there's no way to determine if a pointer points to 'allocated' memory.

2014-05-07 23:02:51	ESphynx	CaZe: if it's weak it will die when whatever those weak strings refer to die
2014-05-07 23:03:08	ESphynx	if you mean for the list to hold the string you make the string own it

2014-05-08 00:57:22	edk	I don't think so; not that I can show you
2014-05-08 00:57:41	Zhivago	mar: You can do that, but then no-one else can use auto storage, for example.
2014-05-08 00:58:00	Zhivago	mar: I don't see the point of playing silly buggers when one line of documentation would do the trick.
2014-05-08 00:58:23	mar77i	sure. except they decide to also use the internal header file.
2014-05-08 00:58:53	Zhivago	In which case ... it isn't internal.
2014-05-08 00:59:03	Zhivago	Or they're not 'someone else'.
2014-05-08 00:59:24	mar77i	true.

2014-05-08 00:59:26	edk	mar77i: you wouldn't normally put an internal header file in your include directory
2014-05-08 00:59:32	edk	(so they can't include it)

2014-05-08 01:45:03	wayne	consfearacy: that's more of a math question than a C question
2014-05-08 01:45:17	wayne	if you have a question about floats/doubles then please rephrase
2014-05-08 01:45:45	consfearacy	how can i get a float number with the longest digits possible?

2014-05-08 01:47:07	wayne	consfearacy: if you want arbitrary-precision floating number check out https://gmplib.org/ or other similar libs

2014-05-08 01:47:31	wayne	consfearacy: if you want the largest floating point C primitive, it's probably long double
2014-05-08 01:48:07	consfearacy	wayne, i tried long double, this is a 64 bit linux system. it didn't work
2014-05-08 01:48:08	wayne	its precision is machine-dependent though
2014-05-08 01:48:19	consfearacy	wayne: it gave me 0.00000
2014-05-08 01:48:51	mar77i	0 is an okay amount if your circles are all of radius 0...
2014-05-08 01:49:34	wayne	consfearacy: 6 digits sounds about right for a float, but a double should be a bit more than twice that
2014-05-08 01:49:58	consfearacy	could someone represent this long rational number in an array or linked link or something?
2014-05-08 01:50:17	wayne	consfearacy: that's what numerical libraries like gmp do
2014-05-08 01:50:40	wayne	by using their implementation instead of rolling your own, you have the benefit of tested and debugged code
2014-05-08 01:50:41	consfearacy	wayne, cant i re-invent the wheel? it is just for learning purposes you see
2014-05-08 01:50:50	wayne	then by all means go right ahead
2014-05-08 01:50:55	consfearacy	wayne.. i am just killing time really
2014-05-08 01:50:56	 *	edk links a link
2014-05-08 01:52:02	consfearacy	i am using this method to calculate it: 3 + 4/2*3*4 - 4/4*5*6 + 4/6*7*8 - 4/8*9*10 + ....
2014-05-08 01:52:19	consfearacy	it will eventually converge
