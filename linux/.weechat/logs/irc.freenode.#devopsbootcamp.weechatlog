2014-05-02 09:33:07	spectralsun	the *only* complaint i have with devops is that i'd like the link to the broadcast to be available 24hrs early
2014-05-02 09:33:12	spectralsun	or 12 or something
2014-05-02 09:33:19	spectralsun	and obviously youtube won't allow this
2014-05-02 09:33:26	spectralsun	so I was thinking do some kind of redirect?
2014-05-02 09:33:36	spectralsun	live.devops.osusl.com
2014-05-02 09:33:38	spectralsun	erm
2014-05-02 09:33:41	spectralsun	org
2014-05-02 09:33:48	pwnguin	well, there's osl.io
2014-05-02 09:33:55	spectralsun	does that show you the feed?
2014-05-02 09:34:01	spectralsun	yeah, embedding it is a better idea
2014-05-02 09:34:06	pwnguin	it's a tinyurl service
2014-05-02 09:34:10	spectralsun	well
2014-05-02 09:34:17	spectralsun	why not have web page up
2014-05-02 09:34:18	edunham	spectralsun: hmm how about putting the link in channel topic?
2014-05-02 09:34:26	spectralsun	edunham: no this is for people who are on irc
2014-05-02 09:34:29	spectralsun	my cousin for example
2014-05-02 09:34:34	edunham	oh ok
2014-05-02 09:34:38	spectralsun	not*
2014-05-02 09:34:43	edunham	actually i think we can pre-schedule
2014-05-02 09:34:48	edunham	is the cousin on the mailing list?
2014-05-02 09:34:57	spectralsun	i'll check
2014-05-02 09:35:39	kennric	btw, how many people at bootcamp this week were -not- employed by osl?
2014-05-02 09:36:10	edunham	uhh... 3 or 4?
2014-05-02 09:36:20	edunham	and an additional 2-3 newbie-OSLers
2014-05-02 09:36:57	spectralsun	kennric: great presentation, you thought about putting a disclaimer when you start talking about PHP first, saying the good stuff is coming?
2014-05-02 09:37:04	spectralsun	;D
2014-05-02 09:37:29	kennric	if we keep hiring people out of bootcamp, it will turn into in-house training :)
2014-05-02 09:37:44	spectralsun	very nice, I hope you'll keep it open source
2014-05-02 09:37:47	spectralsun	as you improve it
2014-05-02 09:38:19	kennric	thanks, it was obviously palnned for a shorter time and more people (extra setup/hands-on time)
2014-05-02 09:38:52	kennric	don't worry, just kidding about the in-house training
2014-05-02 09:38:57	spectralsun	hehe
2014-05-02 09:41:03	edunham	"ha ha only serious" :)
2014-05-02 09:41:26	edunham	it's really awesome to be able to recommend people out of bootcamp for applying to osl -- like "why yes, i actually have seen your work"
2014-05-02 09:48:06	spectralsun	whose idea was it?
2014-05-02 09:48:11	spectralsun	(bootcamp)
2014-05-02 09:55:14	edunham	well kind of Lance's in that he kept saying things about OSL being expected to reach 100 students a year as part of the EECS transition
2014-05-02 09:55:40	edunham	and kind of alan's and askore's and mine, in that we figured out how to modify PSU braindump in a way that'd work
2014-05-02 10:03:00	spectralsun	well its great
2014-05-02 10:03:17	spectralsun	i wish more education was this way
2014-05-02 10:03:27	spectralsun	non-tech stuff
2014-05-02 10:04:14	edunham	I feel like there are programs to teach a lot of assorted non-tech skills that run in a grassroots way like this... things like gardening and carpentry and writing
2014-05-02 10:04:45	spectralsun	yep, but there can always be more
2014-05-02 10:04:56	spectralsun	and its also about getting people access to it
2014-05-02 10:05:00	spectralsun	streamlining the whole process
2014-05-02 10:05:05	spectralsun	thats usually easy with tech
2014-05-02 10:06:46	edunham	s/with/by using/
2014-05-02 10:06:46	hamper	spectralsun actually meant: thats usually easy by using tech

2014-05-07 14:00:53	edunham	I guess maybe at the end it'd be okay?
2014-05-07 14:01:00	edunham	but it really raises more questions than it answers
2014-05-07 14:03:42	edunham	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I94-tJlovg seems more the level of subtlety we're looking for :P

2014-05-12 11:33:22	edunham	Ramereth: is there some resource you used to figure out what to ask on the osl feedback form?
2014-05-12 11:35:39	@Ramereth	which form exactly?
2014-05-12 11:37:54	 *	edunham PMs hackathon feedback form link
2014-05-12 11:38:03	edunham	i'm asking because you said to make the dobc feedback form in the same way
2014-05-12 11:38:21	edunham	and I'm wondering whether there are techniques to picking questions that'll get more useful answers
2014-05-12 11:38:48	edunham	it seems like something that people probably study a lot, but I'm clearly not Googling the right stuff to get useful resources
2014-05-12 11:38:56	@Ramereth	oh, we can just copy what we did before and just adjust it to our needs
2014-05-12 11:39:06	@Ramereth	basically using the schedule 1-5 as a way to gauge stuff
2014-05-12 11:39:12	@Ramereth	want me to make a copy of it and share it with you?
2014-05-12 11:39:18	edunham	nah i already made a copy
2014-05-12 11:39:40	edunham	I was just hoping there was a more concrete philosophy for figuring out questions than "take a good guess" :)
2014-05-12 11:39:56	@Ramereth	i can give you a few ideas if you want
2014-05-12 11:40:21	edunham	yeah I have a pretty good idea already so I'll write that up and send it to you to see if I missed anything
2014-05-12 11:40:28	@Ramereth	that works
2014-05-12 11:40:46	@Ramereth	mainly want to know what they liked, disliked, things they may be interested in, etc
