2014-05-12 21:30:38	Guest88776	anybody feel like answering some c questions?
2014-05-12 21:31:12	HNO3	Go ahead.
2014-05-12 21:31:45	Guest88776	OK here it goes. I am trying to write a fairly large project in c, but I am unsure how to go about it. I have always programmed in an OOP language such as: Java and C++. I know how to write a program in c, that is not the issue. I just don't know how to design a program that has a few thousand lines of code in a language like c that doesn't use objects like C++, which I am really used to doing. I know there are better languages suited for doi
2014-05-12 21:31:45	Guest88776	ng the project other than C, but where is the fun in that. I have started to work on a few parts of the program, and I have been using structs and passing them around like I would do object, but I wasn't sure if that is the proper way of programming in c because of my OOP mentality.
2014-05-12 21:32:19	HNO3	Maybe you first confusion comes from the assumption that C doesn't has objects.
2014-05-12 21:33:05	HNO3	OOP existed in C long before C++ had it. In fact, OOP is older than that.
2014-05-12 21:33:20	Guest88776	do you mean structs? I know that classes in an oop language are essentially stucts but with encapsulation.
2014-05-12 21:33:38	HNO3	It's not encapsulated by the language.
2014-05-12 21:33:48	HNO3	But they are equivalent in functionality, yes.
2014-05-12 21:34:01	HNO3	If that's what you meant.

2014-05-12 21:34:50	HNO3	Just as you would in C++, with C you define how you'll structure you data first in a way that makes sense when you're going to use it.
2014-05-12 21:35:11	HNO3	Then, you write functions that'll work with that piece of data in particuliar.
2014-05-12 21:35:27	HNO3	It's common to have these functions prefixed, and the code divided into modules.
2014-05-12 21:35:44	HNO3	For example, you could have player_attack(), player_move(), player_trade(), etc.
2014-05-12 21:36:54	Guest88776	OK I wasn't sure if I was trying to be object oriented. So basically I can design a program just as I would with an oop language but instead of classes just use structs.
2014-05-12 21:37:00	HNO3	player_attack() could easily take two objects of type `struct player`, where one is attacking the other. Then you're able to calculate the dmg of one, and substract from the health of the other.
2014-05-12 21:37:10	HNO3	It's fairly easy when you think in terms of your data.
2014-05-12 21:38:18	Guest88776	Yea when you explain it, it is easy to understand.

2014-05-12 21:39:01	Guest88776	Thanks for the help.
2014-05-12 21:39:12	HNO3	You can mimick inheritance with adding an inventory field to the `struct player`, a `struct inventory` to keep it simple and manually pass the `player->inventory` to inventory_something() functions.

2014-05-12 21:39:46	HNO3	Another way (more OOP-like) is having that member be the exactly first member of the struct, that way, you can do type juggling and cast one to the other safely.

2014-05-12 21:40:52	HNO3	But that's only interesting if you have multiple objects based on the same other object. e.g. TileGround, TileWall, TileChair, from some generic Tile.
2014-05-12 21:41:51	HNO3	Lastly, if it's very necessary and your object needs to trigger a callback when something happens relevant to itself, yet, that something may change, well C has function pointers.
2014-05-12 21:42:13	HNO3	You can have a function pointer in your struct and call your callback, whatever it is, just like any regular function.

2014-05-12 21:42:25	HNO3	player->onHit()
2014-05-12 21:42:59	HNO3	Though, i'd personally prefer, player_onHit(target, ...);
2014-05-12 21:43:22	HNO3	It's only useful if there's multiple _onHit logic I suppose, which may change at run-time.
2014-05-12 21:43:44	HNO3	It's the same thing as protected method in a class that you'd override by another.

2014-05-14 11:13:21	grazfather	hey guys. Is there an easy way to understand when casting how much is casted without needing a ton of brackets? For example I have a script with a member that's a char pointer. What part of it is casted in this case: (int*)(key[0].kc)[1] vs ((int*)key[0].kc)[1] where kc is the char pointer but I want to get the SECOND set of four bytes
