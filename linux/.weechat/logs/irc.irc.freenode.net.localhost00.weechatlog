2014-05-15 23:54:54	muricula	hey, how are you?
2014-05-15 23:55:04	localhost00	Fine. Getting over a bit of a cold.
2014-05-15 23:55:19	muricula	I was going to read up on the fourier transform tonight, but I decided to hang out with some friends instead
2014-05-15 23:55:19	localhost00	And grading midterms.
2014-05-15 23:55:25	localhost00	Ah
2014-05-15 23:55:28	muricula	may it pass
2014-05-15 23:55:33	muricula	(the cold)
2014-05-15 23:55:59	localhost00	Well, I had a nap earlier after class, and that really put me mostly past it.
2014-05-15 23:56:28	localhost00	Finished grading, then decided to go to Dixon.
2014-05-15 23:57:04	muricula	cool
2014-05-15 23:57:22	localhost00	I heard you had a take-home midterm.
2014-05-15 23:59:00	muricula	oh yes. that was a good thing
2014-05-15 23:59:36	localhost00	Yeah, I am going to do a take-home portion for the final exam this term.
2014-05-16 00:00:00	localhost00	Looking forward to going to Mozilla this summer?
2014-05-16 00:02:01	muricula	hell yeah! What are you up to?
2014-05-16 00:02:10	localhost00	Teaching 254.
2014-05-16 00:02:43	localhost00	And hoping I will be within sight of finishing.
2014-05-16 00:02:46	muricula	fun
2014-05-16 00:02:52	localhost00	I got some reconstructions hot off the press this past week.
2014-05-16 00:03:39	localhost00	One of these days, I’d like to make another trip to the Bay Area.
2014-05-16 00:03:55	localhost00	I have a couple of uncles down there, and a friend from Arizona who now lives in Sunnyvale.
2014-05-16 00:03:57	muricula	good locuk
2014-05-16 00:07:27	localhost00	http://shersonb.net/Research/f.png
2014-05-18 02:10:26	localhost00	Say, would you, Jeffrey, and Evan be interested in riding next Wednesday?
2014-05-18 02:11:11	localhost00	Evening, like 6
2014-05-18 14:22:50	muricula	We have a physics exam then, so no, sorry.

2014-05-19 22:20:34	localhost00	So Facebook seems to be under the impression that we know each other, and when I talked with Jeffrey earlier today, it was suggested we all get into a Facebook group chat. You have any objections?
2014-05-19 22:20:59	localhost00	Group chat regarding the bike ride, that is.
2014-05-20 11:58:02	muricula	localhost00: jeff prefers facebook chat or google hangouts to irc, for whatever reason
2014-05-22 18:16:48	localhost00	Eh, I am fine with either. Though I have ##Weyoun here (and #Weyoun on Insomnia) if you want to conference in there.
2014-05-22 18:17:24	localhost00	Also, has Evan received my request on FB yet?

2014-05-28 16:25:16	muricula	I am but I'm busy, ping me another time
2014-05-28 16:25:26	localhost00	Ah, okay.
2014-05-28 16:25:41	localhost00	Just asked a question last night.

2014-06-06 00:18:24	localhost00	<_<
2014-06-06 00:18:29	localhost00	I tried
2014-06-06 00:18:31	 *	localhost00 tries again
2014-06-06 00:19:19	localhost00	We're sorry, we couldn't sign you up for Trakcat. You may have chosen a username already in use by someone else, or maybe you left one of the fields blank.
2014-06-06 00:20:04	localhost00	So did someone already take localhost00 or something?
2014-06-06 00:20:07	muricula	no
2014-06-06 00:20:17	localhost00	Also, why not ask to confirm password?
2014-06-06 00:20:42	muricula	Well your data is in the db
2014-06-06 00:20:48	muricula	Let me take a look at this
2014-06-06 00:20:55	localhost00	O.o
2014-06-06 00:21:03	muricula	it's so jank
2014-06-06 00:21:13	localhost00	Inquiry, sir... jank?
2014-06-06 00:21:30	muricula	janky
2014-06-06 00:21:47	localhost00	As in buggy?
2014-06-06 00:21:58	muricula	google might do a better job than I
2014-06-06 00:22:02	localhost00	:P
2014-06-06 00:22:32	localhost00	I once made a message board from scratch, but this was probably a decade ago.
2014-06-06 00:22:49	localhost00	And, don’t laugh, I did it in WinBatch, and used a Microsoft Access database.
2014-06-06 00:23:05	muricula	ewww. I suppose php is better than some things
2014-06-06 00:23:28	localhost00	Well, I have been meaning to do it in Python since then
2014-06-06 00:23:43	localhost00	Though I am afraid my web development skills is stuck in the middle of last decade.
2014-06-06 00:23:50	localhost00	*are
2014-06-06 00:24:11	muricula	okay I you can log in now. Hopefully I fixed the bug
2014-06-06 00:25:41	localhost00	Say... I wonder if Facebook will allow you to change your name to İan (with the dot)
2014-06-06 00:25:49	muricula	yes
2014-06-06 00:25:52	muricula	I think
2014-06-06 00:25:56	localhost00	lol
2014-06-06 00:37:30	localhost00	Say.... Wouldn’t visiting http://people.oregonstate.edu/~kronquii/karma.php itself be a distraction?
2014-06-06 00:37:52	muricula	It's supposed to be very simple
2014-06-06 00:37:55	muricula	but yes
2014-06-06 00:39:53	localhost00	What class is it for?
2014-06-06 00:40:47	muricula	databases
2014-06-06 00:40:55	localhost00	Ah
2014-06-06 00:42:31	localhost00	Any other fun projects this term?
2014-06-06 00:42:37	muricula	nope
2014-06-06 00:42:54	muricula	this isn't really that fun, it just has a lot of features
2014-06-06 00:43:02	localhost00	Ah
2014-06-06 00:43:28	muricula	hopefully I can get the daily journal to work and then shake it down and it will be done
2014-06-06 00:49:20	localhost00	Ugh... Shitty last words “drive to colorodo tonight. if you don't see much me in the next week and a half i'm probably not dead”
2014-06-06 00:49:32	localhost00	He died the next day in a car crash. :'(
