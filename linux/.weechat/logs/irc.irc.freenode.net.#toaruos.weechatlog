2014-06-06 13:35:00	muricula	klange: Hey, I might be interested in contributing this summer. I've played around with a kernel before and have some experience with C. I hear you are busy implementing the networking stack, is there a small part of that I could possibly work on sometime after next week?
2014-06-06 13:35:25	@klange	could always use more NIC card drivers
2014-06-06 13:35:43	@klange	... ATM machines. "NIC drivers" is obviously what I meant.
2014-06-06 13:37:16	muricula	Is there a particular NIC driver which you'd like to tackle that I should take a look at?
2014-06-06 13:37:29	muricula	or rather NIC model
2014-06-06 13:37:36	@klange	NE2k should be a quick one, but what I'd really like is some Intel cards.
2014-06-06 13:37:54	@klange	'Course, that all still depends on a generic infrastructure which is part of what I'm working on these days.
2014-06-06 13:38:53	@klange	I'll try to get the existing stuff decoupled from the RTL8139 driver this weekend.
2014-06-06 13:39:07	@klange	And hopefully also get some userspace sockets.
2014-06-06 13:39:23	@klange	But I've been saying I'd do that for two or three weeks now, so... ;)
2014-06-06 13:41:48	muricula	Alright, I have some research to do. I'll keep in touch

2014-06-06 21:09:51	@klange	yeah, about on par with the rtl8139, but I'm lazy

2014-06-06 22:03:19	@klange	i guess
2014-06-06 22:03:34	@klange	not quite a socket
2014-06-06 22:03:40	@klange	but it does mean I could expose *something* to userspace

2014-06-20 04:49:42	txzn	Hey.
2014-06-20 04:49:45	txzn	Can someone test this on something else than Linux? http://syx.sk/~zxtlpn/test.c
2014-06-20 04:49:47	txzn	It should go into a loop, but on Linux it does a sepukku the second time.
2014-06-20 04:50:09	mniip	"run this C file"
2014-06-20 04:50:11	mniip	seems legit
2014-06-20 04:50:49	graphitemaster	it's a little better than "run this binary"
2014-06-20 04:51:34	mniip	I have set up the SEGV handler, and about to trigger it

2014-06-20 04:51:35	mniip	Segmentation fault
2014-06-20 04:51:43	txzn	Where?
2014-06-20 04:52:00	txzn	The operating system, I mean.
2014-06-20 04:52:11	mniip	3.14.0-gentoo
2014-06-20 04:52:41	txzn	I don't want Linux. I have already confirmed it does this.
2014-06-20 04:55:00	mniip	strange
2014-06-20 04:55:07	mniip	no signal logs in dmesg
2014-06-20 05:04:32	mniip	txzn, found the problem
2014-06-20 05:04:51	txzn	Awesome.
2014-06-20 05:05:04	mniip	calling signal() adds 0x400 to SigCgt
2014-06-20 05:05:12	mniip	entering the sighandler adds 0x400 to SigBlk
2014-06-20 05:05:22	mniip	execing removes 0x400 from SigCgt
2014-06-20 05:05:25	mniip	but not from SigBlk
2014-06-20 05:05:43	txzn	Okay, I'll look into that.
2014-06-20 05:05:48	mniip	hence despite the sighandler is set, it's blocked and the segfault passes
2014-06-20 05:12:31	txzn	mniip: thank you very much, reseting the block mask makes it work.
2014-06-20 05:16:45	txzn	This is rather unintuitive.
