2014-06-04 14:36:22	jordane	I built a venv that should work with all the standard libs and headers you need: staff.osuosl.org/~jordane/venv.tar.gz I was able to build things with lxml and other headers with it. it works on flip
2014-06-04 15:14:44	jordane	that venv won't work on onid though.
2014-06-04 15:28:02	muricula	thanks so much
2014-06-04 15:29:07	muricula	So I'm considering writing a cron job that will rsync the data I want from onid to flip, and another one on flip which will make the svgs and rsync them back to flip to be served.
2014-06-04 15:29:22	muricula	ewww
2014-06-04 15:31:06	jordane	>.<
2014-06-04 15:31:50	muricula	crap - flip won't let me use cron, but onid will.
2014-06-04 15:31:52	jordane	if that venv doesn't work, then pull in http://staff.osuosl.org/~jordane/deb.tar.gz, unpack it, and run ./deb/usr/bin/virtualenv
2014-06-04 15:32:09	jordane	flip doesn't allow cron? that is silly.
2014-06-04 15:32:39	jordane	but you could always run a cron on onid that sshs to flip..
2014-06-04 15:34:19	muricula	well as long as I'm doing these nasty things, I might as well
2014-06-04 15:39:03	jordane	Yeah :\
