2014-04-30 13:03:05	pwnguin	as i understand it, the coffee service is paid out of Net's foundation budget
2014-04-30 13:03:39	pwnguin	unless you mean the other water device

2014-04-30 13:14:39	bryon	i think it probably works fine, but i exhausted its reserve by making coffee
2014-04-30 13:14:45	bryon	sorry
2014-04-30 13:20:34	chance	jordane: had another question, chef related.
2014-04-30 13:21:13	chance	i have vagrant, and non vagrant environments. non vagrant envs we should clone GWM, in Vagrant we should clone *if* the GWM checkout is not there via shared folders
2014-04-30 13:21:43	chance	but im curious if i add a not_if guard into the git resource, then it will never update revisions if the checkouts already there
2014-04-30 13:24:37	+jordane	chance: Yeah, good question. If you add a not_if guard based on the existence of the dir, it likely won't update
2014-04-30 13:24:46	+jordane	You could instead check for the existence of a mounted share folder
2014-04-30 13:25:10	chance	well that's what id be doing
2014-04-30 13:25:26	chance	::File.directory?(node['gwm']['path'])
2014-04-30 13:25:29	chance	basically
2014-04-30 13:25:40	chance	but im just now realizing i can probably check the chef environment
2014-04-30 13:25:48	chance	so if its vagrant it'll check for the directory
2014-04-30 13:25:59	chance	if its not vagrant it wont, and will return false in the not_if

2014-04-30 14:47:09	pwnguin	 Programs that maintain transient UNIX-domain sockets must place them in this directory.
2014-04-30 14:48:38	pwnguin	literally the only place sockets are mentioned in FHS is in /var/run
2014-04-30 14:49:01	pwnguin	perhaps we should patch the mysql cookbook to put the socket there ;)
2014-04-30 14:50:38	+jordane	where is the mysql cookbook putting the sockets?
2014-04-30 14:51:06	pwnguin	/var/lib/mysql/
2014-04-30 14:51:34	+jordane	interesting.
2014-04-30 14:52:30	pwnguin	chance: yea, looks like at least db1 puts it in /var/run
2014-04-30 14:58:35	pwnguin	on the other hand, mysql1 uses /var/lib/mysql
2014-04-30 14:59:28	pwnguin	but it also gives world read access to the dir, so
2014-04-30 15:03:11	chance	that wouldnt be good

2014-05-01 14:09:01	+edunham	a bunch of stuff is on gitolite but not necessarily github... http://git.osuosl.org/
2014-05-01 14:10:03	+lucyw	edunham: there's no .git , but beyond that I'm not sure
2014-05-01 14:15:55	kennric	lucyw: I actually don't know
2014-05-01 14:16:25	kennric	it ought to be in git somewhere
2014-05-01 14:25:10	+edunham	kennric: we had a look and it's in git, but on the develop branch
2014-05-01 14:25:15	+edunham	err, the themes are in git
2014-05-01 14:26:37	+edunham	also d7dev.o.o has been a serveralias to o.o in the vhost since at least november 2013
2014-05-01 14:26:47	+edunham	which... either i can't read vhosts, or the dev site is not actually a dev site at all?

2014-05-01 14:29:00	kennric	interesting
2014-05-01 14:30:11	+edunham	kennric: i'm not sure exactly what the site's setup is supposed to be, but there doesn't appear to be a staging site per se
2014-05-01 14:30:25	+edunham	it looks like the d7 stuff was testing and then we just pointed o.o at it when it was done
2014-05-01 14:30:40	kennric	I didn't have anything to do with that setup, but it sounds a bit confused
2014-05-01 14:30:54	kennric	well, that is a sort of staging...
2014-05-01 14:31:16	+edunham	err... i feel like "used to be staging and is now prod" doesn't really count
2014-05-01 14:31:28	kennric	so the current state of the public site is a develop branch?
2014-05-01 14:31:52	+edunham	lemme double-check that; I know Jenkins is deploying from master
2014-05-01 14:33:22	+edunham	okay, no, lucy was locally on develop, but i'm not finding the .git on web1 (which is itself pretty perplexing
2014-05-01 14:33:26	+edunham	)
2014-05-01 14:33:29	 *	edunham cross-references against Jenkins
2014-05-01 14:33:49	kennric	yeah, the web head setup is confusing
2014-05-01 14:34:10	kennric	but no "staging" website exists separate from the public one?
2014-05-01 14:34:30	+edunham	well, i would personally expect it to live at d7dev
2014-05-01 14:34:34	+edunham	because dev site
2014-05-01 14:35:12	kennric	pwnguin, jordane: what's up with this? ^^
2014-05-01 14:37:42	+edunham	lucyw: found it: path where jenkins will check stuff out is /var/www/osuosl.org/drupal7-osuosl.org/htdocs/sites/default/themes/osuosl-drupal7 on web1
2014-05-01 14:38:08	+jordane	hmm. Sounds like there was a dev site, then o.o was pointed to it, renamed, and the old prod went away
2014-05-01 14:38:13	+jordane	and the dev became the new prod
2014-05-01 14:38:32	+edunham	jordane: yep, that's what i figured
2014-05-01 14:38:40	kennric	can we get a new dev?
2014-05-01 14:38:51	kennric	I think that would be handy
2014-05-01 14:39:01	+edunham	got naming preferences?
2014-05-01 14:39:13	+edunham	also, want Jenkins to pull from develop for it?
2014-05-01 14:39:52	+jordane	Yeah, new dev should be easy. Sounds like edunham is on it
2014-05-01 14:40:09	kennric	yeah, I think that makes the most sense develop->staging, master->production
2014-05-01 14:40:28	kennric	I think something more generic that d7dev though
2014-05-01 14:41:00	kennric	www-stag.o.o? wwwdev?
2014-05-01 14:41:19	+edunham	staging.o.o?
2014-05-01 14:41:36	+jordane	staging.o.o is pretty generic
2014-05-01 14:41:52	+jordane	my vote is for wwwdev
2014-05-01 14:43:03	kennric	staging.o.o is maybe too generic, there are other things to stage than the home page
2014-05-01 14:43:12	kennric	wwwdev is good
2014-05-01 14:43:21	+edunham	ok, wwwdev it is
2014-05-01 14:43:46	kennric	and dev is a better description for the dev site - staging is not the same ad dev
2014-05-01 15:51:25	@Ramereth	wait a second
2014-05-01 15:51:43	@Ramereth	d7dev is NOT prod
2014-05-01 15:51:50	@Ramereth	its a copy of prod
2014-05-01 15:52:13	@Ramereth	but i agree the name should be different
2014-05-01 15:52:31	+edunham	Ramereth: then where is prod?
2014-05-01 15:52:38	+edunham	not web1?
2014-05-01 15:52:39	@Ramereth	/var/www/osuosl.org/drupal7-osuosl.org/htdocs/sites/default
2014-05-01 15:52:47	@Ramereth	/var/www/osuosl.org/drupal7-osuosl.org/htdocs/sites/d7dev.osuosl.org <- dev
2014-05-01 15:52:54	@Ramereth	its using multi-site drupal
2014-05-01 15:52:57	+edunham	OH
2014-05-01 15:53:46	@Ramereth	ideally, i'd like to have wwwdev for lucy and wwwstaging for prepping stuff based on prod
2014-05-01 15:54:28	+edunham	hmm okay
2014-05-01 15:54:31	@Ramereth	can we convert d7dev to be wwwdev and then make a new wwwstaging that's just a copy of prod?
2014-05-01 15:54:32	+edunham	separate databases for them?
2014-05-01 15:54:37	@Ramereth	yes
2014-05-01 15:54:41	+edunham	okay
2014-05-01 15:54:51	@Ramereth	that way lucy can use wwwdev without impacting staging stuff I may do
2014-05-01 15:55:07	@Ramereth	i.e. I'm planning to use the staging site to construct new site page layouts
2014-05-01 15:55:36	+edunham	hmm ok
2014-05-01 16:18:47	+edunham	Ramereth: okay, so the wwwstaging will be inside the same multisite as dev and prod?
2014-05-01 16:20:37	@Ramereth	yes
2014-05-01 16:21:01	+edunham	ok cool
2014-05-01 16:21:28	+edunham	i'll look over the vhost again and see if i can figure out what multisite is actually doing
2014-05-01 16:22:13	@Ramereth	its really easy
2014-05-01 16:22:19	@Ramereth	we may even have something on the docs site about it
2014-05-01 16:22:43	+edunham	oh ok :)

2014-05-01 16:23:19	+edunham	thanks for link though
2014-05-01 16:27:35	+edunham	so, rename the d7dev stuff over to wwwdev, or leave it?

2014-05-02 13:19:52	@Ramereth	chance: sure
2014-05-02 13:20:15	chance	hai
2014-05-02 13:20:30	chance	so apparently Vagrant 1.5 and later requires vagrant-berkshelf 2.0.1 (or newer). Vagrant <1.5 requires vagrant-berkshelf <2.0.0
2014-05-02 13:21:24	chance	so that's something we need to consider
2014-05-02 13:21:38	chance	the newest version of berkshelf works with the older berkshelf stuff, they're still just deprecating it
2014-05-02 13:22:00	chance	like site :opscode is now source "http://api.berkshelf.com"
2014-05-02 13:22:03	@Ramereth	chance: you should talk to jordane about berkshelf stuff but I'd imagine that shouldn't be a problem
2014-05-02 13:22:05	chance	but the old one still works
2014-05-02 13:22:12	chance	yeah, i just wanted to bring up that
2014-05-02 13:24:51	chance	im also strugglign to get berkshelf <2.0.0 installed with vagrant 1.3.5
2014-05-02 13:25:31	@Ramereth	do you think its ok if we pushed out vagrant 1.5.x today?
2014-05-02 13:25:38	chance	possibly
2014-05-02 13:25:46	chance	i didnt run into any issues
2014-05-02 13:25:49	@Ramereth	do you recall issues you ran into?
2014-05-02 13:25:49	chance	just deprecation warnings
2014-05-02 13:25:57	chance	oh
2014-05-02 13:26:29	chance	vagrant-omnibus i think caused me some problems installing berkshelf, because it like, installed a lower version of a berkshelf dependency
2014-05-02 13:26:38	chance	but i think i resovled that by installing berkshelf afterwards
2014-05-02 13:27:01	@Ramereth	alright
2014-05-02 13:27:06	@Ramereth	let me work on getting that ready right now
2014-05-02 13:27:19	+edunham	Ramereth, pwnguin, jordane could I get someone to comment on https://support.osuosl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23804 confirming that Ian's allowed to hand out access to that site?
2014-05-02 13:27:26	chance	we should also look at Chef-dk
2014-05-02 13:27:34	@Ramereth	chance: i think jordane was already looking into that
2014-05-02 13:27:42	chance	cool
2014-05-02 13:27:55	@Ramereth	i'm trying to remember, does it include vagrant?
2014-05-02 13:27:59	chance	i think my problem with berkshelf and vagrant 1.3.5 is that i have a newer version of the berkshelf gem isntalled
2014-05-02 13:28:08	chance	no, i dont think so
2014-05-02 13:28:13	@Ramereth	edunham: should be ok
2014-05-02 13:28:20	chance	it includes chef, which has its own berkshelf gem
2014-05-02 13:28:21	@Ramereth	i know tom, he's a cool guy
2014-05-02 13:28:30	chance	and its own gem thing, so you can keep chef gems with chef
2014-05-02 13:28:38	chance	and seperate from the system/rvm/whatever gems
2014-05-02 13:32:34	chance	apparently vagrant-berkshelf is being deprecated
2014-05-02 13:32:50	chance	i guess it mgiht be worthwhile looking at test kitchen :|
2014-05-02 13:33:31	@Ramereth	we are already looking at it and using it in some capacity
2014-05-02 13:33:36	chance	yeah
2014-05-02 13:33:36	@Ramereth	so that's on our radar
2014-05-02 13:33:44	@Ramereth	pretty much anything new is using TK
2014-05-02 13:34:08	chance	im going to look at it for GWM, and the GWM Chef repo
2014-05-02 13:34:29	@Ramereth	you might take a look at the omnibus jordane has been working
2014-05-02 13:34:55	@Ramereth	there might be some overlap in that depending on how you plan to deploy it
2014-05-02 13:35:24	@Ramereth	i recommend you talk with jordane or armiller first about how TK so you get a sense for how we've used it so far
2014-05-02 13:35:32	@Ramereth	but also obviously go through their guide
2014-05-02 13:35:46	chance	yeah, ideally id just not have berkshelf issues by doing this
2014-05-02 13:35:51	@Ramereth	exactly
2014-05-02 13:35:54	@Ramereth	TK is WAY better
2014-05-02 13:36:05	@Ramereth	I was hoping to switch the vagrant-ganeti to a TK env
2014-05-02 13:36:18	chance	yeah
2014-05-02 13:36:29	chance	ill work on getting GWM switched, shouldnt be too bad.
2014-05-02 13:38:02	@Ramereth	nope, not at all
2014-05-02 13:45:47	+lucyw	Ramereth: so, according to Jenkins, both the BBC and o.o websites have been built in the last few days (BBC in the last ten minutes or so), but neither site has actually updated.  Is this intentional, or is something amiss?
2014-05-02 13:47:03	+armiller	chance: https://github.com/osuosl-cookbooks/workstation/blob/master/.kitchen.yml
2014-05-02 13:48:09	@Ramereth	lucyw: did you do a force refresh with your browser?
2014-05-02 13:48:58	@Ramereth	lucyw: looks like the file needs to be renamed with .rst
2014-05-02 13:49:04	@Ramereth	(at least what's on github)
2014-05-02 13:51:40	+lucyw	Ramereth: yes, though the issue with osuosl.org is still there...
2014-05-02 13:52:04	@Ramereth	what change did you make?
2014-05-02 13:52:52	+lucyw	I changed some of the stylings on the side-bar--nothing major, just some color, font, and padding updates to make it look a little nicer.
2014-05-02 13:53:22	@Ramereth	have you tried looking at the site using https? that wouldn't be cached as much
2014-05-02 13:53:24	+lucyw	I tested everything in the mozilla web-tools, as the dev site looked like it was pointing to the production site.
2014-05-02 13:53:26	@Ramereth	i bet you its still cached
2014-05-02 13:53:44	@Ramereth	the side bar looks different to me
2014-05-02 13:53:54	@Ramereth	did you do a force refresh?
2014-05-02 13:54:15	+lucyw	Oh, well, if it looks different then that's good!  Perhaps it is just my machine then.
2014-05-02 13:54:28	@Ramereth	always make sure you do a force refresh
2014-05-02 13:54:34	@Ramereth	ctrl+shift+r
2014-05-02 13:54:46	@Ramereth	we heavily cache the prod site too
2014-05-02 13:54:53	@Ramereth	so you may need to tell it to flush the css cache
2014-05-02 13:55:02	+lucyw	I cleared the cache on my browser and ctrl+shift+r and it looks the same, but if it looks different for you then I'm not too worried
2014-05-02 13:55:02	@Ramereth	i can show you where that is  if you need help
2014-05-02 13:55:15	@Ramereth	well, come here and you can see if its correct or not
2014-05-02 13:55:25	+lucyw	Nah, I actually have a pretty handy plugin for clearing cache, cookies, history, etc.

2014-05-05 08:09:14	pwnguin	no presenters, just a huge oreilly library and a quiet space away from users / managers
2014-05-05 08:13:21	edunham	that would be amazing :)
2014-05-05 08:13:34	edunham	just... every book Oreilly's ever published and a sound-proof room

2014-05-07 11:53:19	chance	so essentially opposite of what ours is like?
2014-05-07 11:53:51	chance	hot air everywhere except the cold isles, where the racks would face inwards to the cold isle, with the intakes facing the cold, and then hot would just vent into the rest of the data center

2014-05-07 13:12:06	+deanj	Yeah. Meh, we've had a good amount of attendance quizzes, I'm not too worried.
2014-05-07 13:13:13	+deanj	Speaking of things to be worried about though, we should work on our ECE 478 project sometime soon. Maybe this weekend?

2014-05-09 16:24:38	@Ramereth	ya, i was also working towards getting "ownership" of the Open source lab gmap entry. They apparently will snail mail you a postcard with a verify code on it
2014-05-09 16:25:17	@Ramereth	they noticed the Kerr Admin address was different than the 1500 Jefferson address which is why they called

2014-05-14 14:34:18	+edunham	pwnguin: https://rt.orvsd.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=110355 are we still doing moodle courses through the main orvsd page, or does it have to be per district?
2014-05-14 14:43:14	+edunham	Ramereth: do you have a minute for me to barrage you with annoying ORVSD questions?
2014-05-14 14:46:23	@Ramereth	what kind of annoying questions?
2014-05-14 14:49:33	+edunham	there've been several tickets about how to create courses through the main orvsd.org site
2014-05-14 14:49:37	+edunham	are people even supposed to do that?
2014-05-14 14:49:40	+edunham	such as https://rt.orvsd.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=110355
2014-05-14 14:50:09	@Ramereth	we don't use that anymore
2014-05-14 14:50:13	@Ramereth	that's for the old setup
2014-05-14 14:50:44	+edunham	ok
2014-05-14 14:50:50	@Ramereth	orvsd-central is kind of the replacement for that (mostly for the helpdesk)
2014-05-14 14:51:06	+edunham	yeah, i feel like helpdesk should be handling these instead of indiscriminately punting
2014-05-14 14:51:22	+edunham	but anyways
2014-05-14 14:51:25	@Ramereth	let me finally get around to sending that email to steve/helpdesk
2014-05-14 14:51:45	+edunham	this means i get to figure out how to be helpdesk... what should i tell them about how to set up new moodles?
2014-05-14 14:52:25	@Ramereth	let me add that to the email I'll send
2014-05-14 14:52:32	@Ramereth	for now leave them be until I hear back from them
2014-05-14 14:54:54	+edunham	okay
2014-05-14 14:55:24	+edunham	I kind of feel like since she emailed the actual people saying she's handing the ticket to OSL, I need to resolve these ones ASAP or we'll look bad
2014-05-14 15:01:31	+pwnguin	edunham: should i point out that salkeiz.orvsd.org is a drupal site?
2014-05-14 15:02:19	+pwnguin	and that sklonline.org is a moodle site, but run by a specific program administrator
2014-05-14 15:02:46	+edunham	uhh, yeah, should probably correct that
2014-05-14 15:03:16	+edunham	I should probably stop trying to handle that set of tickets until Lance gets a resolution from helpdesk about whose problem they actually are
2014-05-14 15:04:03	@Ramereth	edunham: i'm not worried about us looking bad. I'm more worried about getting this resolved

2014-05-14 15:06:17	@Ramereth	i think its just a simple misunderstanding on stephanie's part

2014-05-14 15:22:23	+pwnguin	well, to a certain degree, we're just seeing the consequences of the backlog buildup
2014-05-14 15:22:39	+edunham	so, should G-apps questions be forwarded to Steve and moved back to the main support queue? https://rt.orvsd.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120837
2014-05-14 15:22:41	+pwnguin	many of the tickets we're seeing are from 2013
2014-05-14 15:25:53	@Ramereth	never directly assign it to steve
2014-05-14 15:26:24	@Ramereth	but in general, the helpdesk should be dealing with any gapp question IMO
2014-05-14 15:28:40	+edunham	okay
2014-05-14 15:28:52	+edunham	kick to their queue with comment explaining that Steve handles all that and we aren't Steve?
2014-05-14 15:30:22	@Ramereth	isn't this related to the email I sent to them? i.e. just wait until I hear back from them?
2014-05-14 15:45:49	+edunham	pwnguin: does 100% done mean we can close https://code.osuosl.org/issues/10413?
