2014-07-01 08:16:44	jnoah	are you still clocking in at the OSL? Your name is all over the calendar, that's why I ask
2014-07-01 10:04:05	muricula	heh, I should fix that, huh?
2014-07-01 10:05:30	jnoah	maybe. i keep expecting you to be there when i see it...then a moment of clarity hits and a homer 'doh' comes out
2014-07-01 10:10:12	muricula	It's fixed now.
2014-07-01 10:10:19	jnoah	awesome, thanks :)
