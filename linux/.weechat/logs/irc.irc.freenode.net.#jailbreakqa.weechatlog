2014-07-01 20:20:43	muricula	Okay... why is that? Is the new jailbreak not open source or something?
2014-07-01 20:21:07	@pangu	no, it's a long story, but if you flash the baseband you brick the phone forever
2014-07-01 20:21:39	+hack	yea, stay far away from that
2014-07-01 20:21:46	+justinred	ohai. slideback is out, a replacement for appslide.
2014-07-01 20:21:53	muricula	pangu: where can I learn about the long story?
2014-07-01 20:21:58	@pangu	you can't unlock with ultrasn0w without flashing the baseband, this only works on 3gs's made before about mid-2011
2014-07-01 20:22:34	@pangu	muricula: the story won't help you, there are no loopholes, but hang on...
2014-07-01 20:22:51	+hack	the 3gs has 4 production years, the 2011 week 35+ devices where fixed
2014-07-01 20:23:02	+hack	so if you flash a phones that's to new it's a brick

2014-07-02 09:04:28	+Will0401	To upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows Vista or Windows XP, you'll need to install it from a Windows 8.1 DVD and perform a clean installation. This means you won't be able to keep any files, settings, or programs when you upgrade.

2014-07-02 10:36:20	hoodie	because its likely that its using some other library thus is not usb complient. DRive docks don't need drivers. they are fully usb 2 complient

2014-07-02 10:38:53	+Yodah	Lol
2014-07-02 10:38:58	hoodie	go for it... its already tested. If it works with SD Cards, and usb thumb drives, a drive in a dock is effectively the same thing as a thumb drive

2014-07-02 12:32:26	hoodie	the visual elements move around too much
2014-07-02 12:32:50	hoodie	because you hit the search field, then it decides you didn' really want to search and makes another visual element come to focus

2014-07-02 12:37:27	hoodie	in the old app, the results listed on the screen would number 8-10
