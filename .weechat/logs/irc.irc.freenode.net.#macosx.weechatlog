2014-06-30 13:42:45	leobut	I have for a long time wondered where the origin of the term "homosexual" came from. The prefix "homo" is otherwise used to refered to difference evolution points of the general human species.
2014-06-30 13:42:45	Cpuroast	exactly
2014-06-30 13:43:23	Cpuroast	homo just mean human
2014-06-30 13:43:27	leobut	But "homosexual" has nothing to do with evolution, but merely about sexual orientation, which is more of a mental state than anything else.
2014-06-30 13:43:36	piercedwater	oh snap
2014-06-30 13:43:51	Cpuroast	homo sapiens

2014-06-30 13:44:12	Cpuroast	you get the idea
2014-06-30 13:44:28	leobut	Yes, homosapiens, homoerectus, etc, so why a terms like "homosexual" that only serves to confuse more than not.
2014-06-30 13:44:29	@rorx	comes from heterogeneous & homogeneous I'd say.
2014-06-30 13:44:38	ianmac1	I work in an industry that is know for shunning homosexuals, but I don't dwell on the sexual orientation of another person.
2014-06-30 13:44:39	Sashimi	homo simply means "same"...

2014-06-30 13:44:52	Cpuroast	in this case
2014-06-30 13:44:57	Cpuroast	yes homo vs hetero
2014-06-30 13:45:09	leobut	ianmac1: I don't care about another person's sexual orientation, as long as they aren't shoving it in my face.

2014-07-01 15:21:37	evilbug	minni: skirt seems a bit long.
2014-07-01 15:21:56	halabund	Doctor: thanks, those are not good for various reasons (not Mac program at all, old and doesn’t work, based on Preview and has the same bug, etc.)  … thanks guys, don’t bother googling as I have already done that.  I was asking in case someone here has already solved the problem.

2014-07-01 15:38:23	alanjf-	aep: What I really dislike is how terms are blatantly hijacked for purposes of (mis)labeling people who disagree with something. Take "homophobic", which actually means "fear of man [kind]", as homo means [hu]man and phobic means a [dibilitating] fear of something. Yet it has been horribly abused into referring to bigotry against homo-sexuals.
