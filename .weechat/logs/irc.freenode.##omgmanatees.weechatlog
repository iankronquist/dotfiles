2014-05-02 10:57:17	@bryon	but the fact that there are people who care deeply enough about such trivial shit that it's considered "news"
2014-05-02 10:59:59	@spectralsun	bryon: such rhetoric is like blaming the rain for being wet
2014-05-02 11:00:11	@spectralsun	instead, realize that the rain makes the sun that much more glorious

2014-05-03 20:59:50	@mythmon	I try not to assume noobs are women...
2014-05-03 21:00:02	edunham	actually Carrie's a pretty cool lady, except for her atypical difficulties doing CS
2014-05-03 21:00:17	@mythmon	well. one might say that difficulty with CS is typical.
2014-05-03 21:00:27	@mythmon	and that those who get it are atypical
2014-05-03 21:00:31	edunham	then again I've never really had conversations with guys who're returning to school for CS after having a career in something like accounting
2014-05-03 21:00:44	edunham	(perhaps the guys just assume i'm incompetent for being female xD)
2014-05-03 21:01:21	edunham	but I suspect her challenges are more related to actually having a life and the whole age thing than to gender
2014-05-03 21:01:29	 *	mythmon nods
2014-05-03 21:01:42	edunham	but yeah, she used to be an accountant, and she's really good at maths

2014-05-03 21:01:48	@bryon	for the record, my extremely sexist statement was purely sarcasm
2014-05-03 21:02:20	@bryon	i don't actually think women can't omputer. what a ridiculous notion.
2014-05-03 21:20:00	edunham	ugh there's a super good link about that
2014-05-03 22:11:52	@mythmon	heh. community does a clip show, except all of the clips are original to the episode.
2014-05-03 22:44:55	@bryon	that show is pretty solid, imho
2014-05-03 22:45:34	@bryon	that assessment may or may not be influenced by my unhealthy infatuation w/ alison brie

2014-05-06 21:09:21	@bryon	mmmm, linux boobs
2014-05-06 21:09:40	@bryon	jnoah and iw ere debating whether they were actual boobs, or moobs
2014-05-06 22:00:43	@edunham	probably actual
2014-05-06 22:01:56	@mythmon	edunham: why do you think?
2014-05-06 22:02:28	@edunham	hmm.
2014-05-06 22:02:58	@edunham	a) nails have a coat of beige or clear polish. not a thing folks with moobs typically wear.
2014-05-06 22:03:43	@mythmon	true.
2014-05-06 22:03:47	@edunham	b) foreshortening of ring and pinkie fingers suggests that bottom of hand is almost flat, and other angles imply that index finger rests at a point ~3" out from ribcage
2014-05-06 22:03:49	@mythmon	but that just means they are likely boob-attached hands.
2014-05-06 22:04:24	@mythmon	ah, good pint.
2014-05-06 22:04:32	@edunham	c) warping of shirt, suggested by text distortion, implies being warped over spheres
2014-05-06 22:05:04	@edunham	this suggests that the shirt is covering a bra, which are rarely go with moob-having types
2014-05-06 22:05:38	@edunham	oh yeah and for [mb]oobs of that size that close to one another, you're looking at 34-38DD or greater
2014-05-06 22:05:58	@edunham	ie skinnier frame, based on their placement
2014-05-06 22:06:03	@bryon	BOOB SCIENCE
2014-05-06 22:06:21	@edunham	and folks with skinny ribcages rarely have that magnitude of moobs unless it's full-on gynomastea or however you spell it
2014-05-06 22:06:31	@edunham	with that said, though, the shirt is probably just on a mannequin.
2014-05-06 22:06:39	@edunham	but it's a mannequin of a female.

2014-05-06 22:09:10	@edunham	it's what I'm going to cite in claiming that for roughly half the population, give or take 25%, bras actually make boobs more aesthetically pleasing from the perspective of mainstream beauty standards
2014-05-06 22:09:42	@edunham	err, half the boob-having population xD

2014-05-06 22:12:27	@bryon	i hear that front-close bras can be inadvertently popped with such as an enthusiastic hug

2014-05-06 22:12:52	@edunham	like, there's two different types of clasps for 'em
2014-05-06 22:13:04	@edunham	the old-fashioned kind, which might very well pop open easily (i wouldn't know)
2014-05-06 22:13:27	@edunham	and then the stupid puzzles that they sometimes attach to the only garment in the store available in the correct size without several cubic inches of padding

2014-05-06 22:15:37	@edunham	and by adventure i mean AARGH
2014-05-06 22:15:47	@bryon	and you have to be careful not to go too far down the skanky ho route
2014-05-06 22:16:08	@bryon	it's a fine line
2014-05-06 22:16:13	@edunham	well, there's that saying about how guys don't mind the lady who's available to everyone, it's the lady who's available to *everyone but them* that they dislike
2014-05-06 22:16:39	@lucyw	Also, let's not even talk about pockets.
2014-05-06 22:16:53	@bryon	pockets++++
2014-05-06 22:17:19	@lucyw	Yes, provided they're more than 1-inch deep and not sewn shut on purchse.
2014-05-06 22:17:28	@bryon	those aren't pockets
2014-05-06 22:17:32	@edunham	meh, i don't mind the sewn shut ones
2014-05-06 22:17:41	@edunham	they're to make the garment hang right
2014-05-06 22:17:50	@edunham	what bugs me is when there's NO POCKET TO OPEN
2014-05-06 22:18:21	@edunham	and like... i've gotten used to girl-jeans-pockets
2014-05-06 22:18:39	@edunham	but every once in awhile i'll observe guy-pants pockets and wonder why i suddenly lost my arm up to the elbow
2014-05-06 22:19:02	@bryon	heheheh
2014-05-06 22:19:13	@bryon	"Holy shit, does this go all the way down to the knee?"
2014-05-06 22:19:14	@edunham	but my trenchoat has man-pockets, so all's well
2014-05-06 22:19:22	@bryon	(not talking about pockets)
2014-05-06 22:19:33	@edunham	xD
2014-05-06 22:19:43	@edunham	well, depends on which man's pocket you're sticking your hand into
2014-05-06 22:20:09	@edunham	my only comment on that type of anatomy is "OW"
2014-05-06 22:20:14	@edunham	s/type/scale
2014-05-06 22:20:15	@mythmon	may i suggest not sticking your hand anywhere up to the elbow on a guy without asking permission first.
2014-05-06 22:20:15	@bryon	no kidding
2014-05-06 22:20:21	@edunham	mythmon: good point
2014-05-06 22:20:31	@edunham	i meant like when one's doing one's guy's laundry or w/e and checking pockets
2014-05-06 22:20:33	@bryon	that sort of anatomy is effectively useless
2014-05-06 22:20:46	@mythmon	edunham: i figured it was while looking at guy's pants in a store.
2014-05-06 22:21:02	@edunham	mythmon: meh, i don't shop for guys' clothes
2014-05-06 22:21:10	@bryon	like the guy w/ the comically huge dong who got stopped by TSA because they thought he had a weapon in his pants
2014-05-06 22:21:12	@edunham	haven't yet gotten up the nerve to figure out sizing and find a brand of guy pants that fits me
2014-05-06 22:21:47	@edunham	*snrk*
2014-05-06 22:22:48	@edunham	yeah so... in my experience, certain encounters with people like that tend to end in a nice scientific explanation of the physical limitations of the human jaw :P
2014-05-06 22:22:59	@edunham	aka, "NOPE and you couldn't do that either"
2014-05-06 22:23:05	@bryon	heheh
2014-05-06 22:23:06	@edunham	aaanyways
2014-05-06 22:23:33	@edunham	not fun times. moderation++
2014-05-06 22:23:39	@bryon	indeed
2014-05-06 22:24:11	@bryon	too much of anything isn't a good idea
2014-05-06 22:24:20	@edunham	except chocolate.
2014-05-06 22:24:48	@bryon	well, i can't much argue with that

2014-05-06 22:27:28	@mythmon	(free booze)++
2014-05-06 22:27:38	@edunham	but yeah, (free booze)++ at conferences is totally a thing.
2014-05-06 22:32:13	@mythmon	hamper: should I share with the class?

2014-05-06 22:39:15	@edunham	good luck
2014-05-06 22:39:31	@mythmon	edunham: alternatively, make a mold of a real object, and then go through the rest of the steps.
2014-05-06 22:39:42	@bryon	hrmm...  i'll need to recruit some volunteers for comparison
2014-05-06 22:39:58	@bryon	i wonder if asosu will let me hang flyers soliciting volunteers
2014-05-06 22:40:14	@mythmon	i wonder if you would get any.

2014-05-13 10:48:34	@bryon	Beyond providing social engagement and distraction in the material realm of work or play, the need for transcendence, solitude and spiritual communion is addressed with the ubiquitous availability and universally endorsed consumption of the drug soma. Soma is an allusion to a ritualistic drink of the same name consumed by ancient Indo-Aryans. In the book, soma is a hallucinogen that takes users on enjoyable, hangover-free "holidays".

2014-05-14 07:40:52	@edunham	*tumblritis
2014-05-14 07:41:14	@lrr	i mean, why would anyone *want* to be fat?
2014-05-14 07:41:38	@lrr	so much so that they would wear foam in order to look fat while they are trying to become fat?
2014-05-14 07:42:26	@edunham	that's a cis-hetero-slim-normative thing to say :P
2014-05-14 07:42:54	@edunham	i think, if it's serious, it's 'cause they want to fit in with a particular community
2014-05-14 07:43:09	@edunham	and that's a community that prises being discriminated against for its fatness
2014-05-14 07:43:11	@lrr	also, what is cis?
2014-05-14 07:44:12	@edunham	in tumblr-ese, it means "you identify with the traits that you were born with", more or less
2014-05-14 07:44:25	@edunham	opposite of trans-
2014-05-14 07:44:44	@edunham	ie, you were born male, and you identify as male, and thus you are a cis-male with cisgendered privelige xD
2014-05-14 07:44:56	@edunham	silly extremists are silly, though.
2014-05-14 07:45:17	@lrr	well i've heard it in the context of gender stuff, not tumbler-ese
2014-05-14 07:45:44	@lrr	i was just never sure what cis meant

2014-05-14 09:34:50	@MaraJade	edunham: I made the connection of "trans-fat" with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat
2014-05-14 09:35:42	@lrr	same here. i was very confused at first and then I saw cis and later in the pic i finally made the connection that the person wanted to "become" fat...
2014-05-14 09:36:34	@edunham	MaraJade++
2014-05-14 09:36:36	@edunham	now i get the pun
2014-05-14 09:36:36	@MaraJade	I actually made the connection after a while. At first I just read it similarly to transgendered. It's more funny the other way though
2014-05-14 09:36:44	@edunham	yes
2014-05-14 09:37:02	@MaraJade	Mostly because I was connecting it to eating disorders lol
2014-05-14 09:37:06	@edunham	heh

2014-05-14 12:31:57	@bryon	i really want to believe that transfat posting was just someone being ridiculous and poking fun at people who get riled up for no real reason
2014-05-14 12:33:05	@bryon	like, "I'M A GAY VEGAN NAZI BLACK PANTHER, AND HOW DARE YOU FLAUNT YOUR PRIVILEGE IN FRONT OF ME!"
2014-05-14 12:33:36	@bryon	it's very rare that i see a tumblr post that is actually clever or amusing

2014-05-14 13:21:13	@bryon	and we were talking about window managers, so... maybe?
2014-05-14 13:21:36	@bryon	what is it actually called?
2014-05-14 13:21:49	@edunham	herbstluft
2014-05-14 13:22:07	@edunham	bryon: also the answer is "no, talking about it as herb slut does not belong in public channel"
2014-05-14 13:24:37	@bryon	i dunno...  i feel like if the linux users in the osu lug can't chuckle at a window manager's name, then what ?
2014-05-14 13:24:47	@bryon	i mean, i'll not call it that again in the channel if you want
2014-05-14 13:24:50	@bryon	no problem
2014-05-14 13:25:17	@edunham	sorry I just feel like when I start calling one person on sexist/impolite language in channel, I have to do it to everybody
2014-05-14 13:25:26	@bryon	i get that
2014-05-14 13:25:34	@bryon	i'm big on consistency
2014-05-14 13:25:41	@edunham	ya so that was my obligatory criticism for the sake of consistency
2014-05-14 13:25:46	@edunham	that's all
2014-05-14 13:25:49	@bryon	but it's not like i said "whoever uses unity is stupid"
2014-05-14 13:26:25	@bryon	but i support you in your endeavors to be consistent. =]
2014-05-14 14:01:25	@edunham	:)
2014-05-14 14:01:40	@edunham	this is more along the lines of banning the 'ur a faget' language
2014-05-14 14:02:00	@bryon	yeah
2014-05-14 14:03:29	@bryon	also, telling me the translation is very helpful for my remembering the actual word
2014-05-14 14:03:33	@bryon	thanks for that
2014-05-14 14:04:04	@edunham	np
2014-05-14 14:12:35	@lrr	heh, when i read "ur a faget" i thought of some horribly done paraody twitter accounts
