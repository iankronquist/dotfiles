2014-04-30 15:48:30	muricula	so I'm going to make an encrypted databag for the orvsd chef repo
2014-04-30 15:49:05	+jordane	muricula: Are we the only ones that are going to be using it?
2014-04-30 15:49:15	+jordane	e.g random orvsd guy doesn't need/care about it?
2014-04-30 15:49:24	muricula	I obviously need keys for this. The chef tutorial almost makes it seem as though I need personal keys, but keys for orvsd really need to be in the hands of the osl
2014-04-30 15:49:45	+jordane	muricula: We have a key. Have you read https://docs.osuosl.org/config-management/chef/workstation-configuration.html ?
2014-04-30 15:49:48	muricula	jordane: yes
2014-04-30 15:49:54	+jordane	at the bottom of Repository Setup
2014-04-30 15:49:55	kennric	jordane: no one else will need to use it
2014-04-30 15:50:05	muricula	nope. I'll take a look
2014-04-30 15:50:24	+jordane	muricula: yeah, make sure you copy the encrypted_data_bag_secret
2014-04-30 15:50:28	+jordane	that's the key you need.
2014-04-30 15:53:06	chance	i can also like cp it to his homedir
2014-04-30 15:53:12	chance	but he still needs .pem keys right?
2014-04-30 15:53:15	muricula	okay, do I need a personal key as well?
2014-04-30 15:53:22	+jordane	Yeah, you do need to generate your own
2014-04-30 15:53:28	+jordane	the knife configure -i will do that
2014-04-30 15:53:35	+jordane	muricula: but first, what version of chef are you using?
2014-04-30 15:53:45	+jordane	knife --version
2014-04-30 15:54:31	muricula	okay, so the version on the workstations is 11.6.0
2014-04-30 15:54:40	+jordane	okay, cool. Should work fine then.
2014-04-30 15:54:52	+jordane	There's a bug with 11.12.2 where knife configure -i just explodes
2014-04-30 15:55:27	muricula	so that knife command asks for the url of a chef server. Right now I'm just messing with a vm
2014-04-30 15:55:45	+jordane	https://chef.osuosl.org
2014-04-30 15:55:57	+jordane	It won't set up a node, just a client.
2014-04-30 15:56:00	muricula	okay
2014-04-30 15:56:06	+jordane	You'll be able to talk to the chef server, get info, etc.
2014-04-30 15:56:12	+jordane	A node is what actually runs chef-client
2014-04-30 15:56:50	+jordane	a client is a thing that the chef-server acknowledges
2014-04-30 15:56:56	+jordane	all nodes are clients, not all clients are nodes
2014-04-30 15:57:07	chance	yep
2014-04-30 15:57:12	chance	that was a hard part for me to understand
2014-04-30 15:57:43	+jordane	chance: heh. For me it was the attribute precedence ordering.
2014-04-30 15:57:54	+jordane	I hate that they swap cookbook and role in override.
2014-04-30 15:57:54	muricula	So that doesn't generate my key, in fact it complains that it can't find my key in the admin file
2014-04-30 15:58:00	chance	that stills kills me cause its got far too many levels of precedence
2014-04-30 15:58:25	+jordane	err, roles and environments

2014-05-01 16:03:08	+Ramereth	jordane: well, that's cool. mind pushing the code up?
2014-05-01 16:04:19	+jordane	Ramereth: yeah, thinking about what to do with the extra defs I added to omnibus-software.
2014-05-01 16:04:31	+jordane	right now I have them on my own fork
2014-05-01 16:04:37	+Ramereth	wait, so you added it to omnibus-software?
2014-05-01 16:04:41	+Ramereth	what deps did you add?
2014-05-01 16:04:47	+jordane	sqlite, readline
2014-05-01 16:04:54	+jordane	I didn't add gwm to omnibus-software
2014-05-01 16:05:14	+Ramereth	no, you don't want to add it there
2014-05-01 16:05:17	+jordane	I also patched ssl.
2014-05-01 16:05:27	+Ramereth	just add it inside of the gwm repo
2014-05-01 16:05:33	+jordane	Well, I added them there for now because it seemed like upstream might be interested.
2014-05-01 16:05:44	+jordane	Also I had to patch upstream's openssl
2014-05-01 16:05:46	+Ramereth	we need to see what they're planning on doing
2014-05-01 16:05:47	+jordane	:\
2014-05-01 16:06:02	+Ramereth	that PR seemed to be in limbo which included a bunch of stuff
2014-05-01 16:06:06	+jordane	Yep.
2014-05-01 16:06:14	+jordane	I think I might have a few deps from that PR too.
2014-05-01 16:06:28	+pwnguin	i almost think we should reword that line to say 'voicemail'
2014-05-01 16:06:50	+pwnguin	or, use the general NOC #
2014-05-01 16:07:31	chance	Ramereth: jordane what deps are you adding to GWM?
2014-05-01 16:07:43	+jordane	chance: none to gwm. Just building them via omnibus
2014-05-01 16:07:56	chance	well he suggested adding some deps to the gwm repo
2014-05-01 16:07:57	+Ramereth	jordane: we really need to see what they're planning to do with that PR before we can decide what to do
2014-05-01 16:08:03	+jordane	chance: different repo
2014-05-01 16:08:07	+jordane	chance: we're talking about the omnibus gwm repo
2014-05-01 16:08:10	chance	ok
2014-05-01 16:08:14	+jordane	Ramereth: agreed.
2014-05-01 16:08:16	+Ramereth	jordane: but my general idea is you can add it locally to that repo and remove it later as its added to the upstream repo
2014-05-01 16:08:21	+Ramereth	much easier to manage from our point of view
2014-05-01 16:08:27	+jordane	Yeah, that is probably a good way to do it.
2014-05-01 16:08:34	+jordane	At least until they sort out what they're doing.
2014-05-01 16:08:41	+Ramereth	is there at least an issue/PR about openssl?
2014-05-01 16:08:54	+Ramereth	although changing the default_version for it probably should fix ti
2014-05-01 16:09:06	+jordane	the default version is latest :\
2014-05-01 16:09:18	+jordane	there is a PR to patch it in openssl source
2014-05-01 16:09:19	+Ramereth	so why does it need to be patched? I thought the latest version was patched?
2014-05-01 16:09:25	+jordane	it's a docs patch
2014-05-01 16:09:36	+jordane	the docs fail to build on modernish versions of perl
2014-05-01 16:09:52	 *	Ramereth is confused why you even needed to touch openssl
2014-05-01 16:10:29	+jordane	Ramereth: I had to touch it because it wouldn't build at all.
2014-05-01 16:10:40	+jordane	https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/57
2014-05-01 16:10:41	+Ramereth	huh? i've never had problems with it
2014-05-01 16:10:52	+jordane	Ramereth: what version of perl were you building with?
2014-05-01 16:10:54	+Ramereth	what OS are you building it on?
2014-05-01 16:10:58	+jordane	debian
2014-05-01 16:11:01	+Ramereth	on your workstation?
2014-05-01 16:11:15	+Ramereth	are you using test kitchen?
2014-05-01 16:11:22	+jordane	my workstation.
2014-05-01 16:11:30	+Ramereth	i dont' recommend doing that with omnibus dev
2014-05-01 16:11:31	+jordane	playing around with test kitchen now.
2014-05-01 16:11:48	+Ramereth	please use 1204 and try it there
2014-05-01 16:11:54	+Ramereth	kitchen will only setup the basic env
2014-05-01 16:12:07	+Ramereth	you still have to ssh into it and then run bundle, and then omnibus
2014-05-01 16:12:12	+jordane	yep
2014-05-01 16:12:18	+jordane	testing it there now
2014-05-01 16:12:19	+Ramereth	I really recommend doing it that way
2014-05-01 16:12:22	+Ramereth	as I know it "works"
2014-05-01 16:12:29	+Ramereth	but ya, they need to fix it on debian obviously
2014-05-01 16:12:45	+jordane	Yeah, and some newer ubuntu.
2014-05-01 16:12:56	+jordane	Wait, does the sqlite and readline stuff work on ubuntu 12.04 in test kitchen?
2014-05-01 16:13:10	+jordane	or does it build them without linking them?
2014-05-01 16:13:21	+Ramereth	what do you mean?
2014-05-01 16:13:28	+jordane	you said it works on ubuntu 12.04
2014-05-01 16:13:39	+armiller	Are we going to upgrade moodle this summer?
2014-05-01 16:13:46	+armiller	I thought that was the normal process
2014-05-01 16:14:01	+Ramereth	jordane: what is requiring readline?
2014-05-01 16:14:07	+jordane	Ramereth: sqlite
2014-05-01 16:14:14	+jordane	by default it links against it.
2014-05-01 16:15:09	+Ramereth	https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/pull/127/files
2014-05-01 16:15:12	+Ramereth	just disable it for now :)
2014-05-01 16:15:25	+Ramereth	a lot of this will be resolved once they figure out how they're going to manage all these deps
2014-05-01 16:15:48	+jordane	yeah
2014-05-01 16:16:30	+Ramereth	the whole sqlite thing bugs me that they don't have that in there already
2014-05-01 16:16:36	+Ramereth	seems like a no brainer
2014-05-01 16:16:41	+jordane	Same
2014-05-01 16:16:54	+jordane	Ramereth: it's also worth noting the python def just rm -rf's all the readline stuff away from python
2014-05-01 16:17:47	+jordane	!fire sqlite
2014-05-01 16:17:47	 *	manatee fires sqlite for the 2nd time!
2014-05-01 16:17:50	+jordane	for its weird version numbers
2014-05-01 16:18:14	+Ramereth	i really doubt you need readline for what we're using here
2014-05-01 16:18:16	+Ramereth	but i might be wrong
2014-05-01 16:18:34	+jordane	Ramereth: Yeah, I don't think we do. It just bothers me that their approach is to rm -rf it out of the source
2014-05-01 16:20:17	+Ramereth	ya i agree. I'd like to know why they decided to do that
2014-05-01 16:20:54	+jordane	I'm not sure, I haven't looked back in git blame/github issues/opscode jira
2014-05-01 16:21:09	+Ramereth	but then again, if we don't run into problems I don't see why its an issue
2014-05-01 16:21:14	+jordane	fair enough
2014-05-01 16:21:23	+Ramereth	pick your battles
2014-05-01 16:21:30	+Ramereth	it might just be to save on space for something that isn't needed
2014-05-01 16:21:42	+Ramereth	i wouldn't go down that rabbit hole too much
2014-05-01 16:22:12	+jordane	yeah, good point.
2014-05-01 16:26:27	+Ramereth	at least not until they get a more concrete plan in place
2014-05-01 16:26:39	+Ramereth	i find it amusing that they're essentially reimplementing the portage tree
2014-05-01 16:26:52	+jordane	Yeah, me too..
2014-05-01 16:28:24	+Ramereth	but they probalby thought "Gentoo sucks!" except for when you're doing somethign like this...
2014-05-01 16:29:14	+jordane	Let's reinvent portage in ruby!
2014-05-01 16:29:43	+jordane	it was weird how close the software defs look like ebuilds
2014-05-01 16:30:35	+Ramereth	i know right?
2014-05-01 16:30:42	+Ramereth	in some ways its a lot more simple
2014-05-01 16:33:06	+jordane	Yeah, that is both good and bad though.
2014-05-01 16:33:34	+Ramereth	yup
2014-05-01 16:33:47	+Ramereth	but i can really see a need for things like use flags
2014-05-01 16:33:59	+jordane	Yep
2014-05-01 16:34:05	+Ramereth	i.e. what if you need to enable a flag for python that isnt' there by default?
2014-05-01 16:34:12	+Ramereth	solution now is to copy what they had into your own repo
2014-05-01 16:34:13	+jordane	like sqlite? :)
2014-05-01 16:34:16	+Ramereth	not exactly sustainable
2014-05-01 16:34:18	+Ramereth	yup exactly
2014-05-01 16:34:31	+jordane	Yeah..
2014-05-01 16:35:02	+jordane	I do like the test kitchen half-integration.
2014-05-01 16:36:15	+Ramereth	its almost there
2014-05-01 16:36:31	+Ramereth	you might take a look at their jenkins scripts in the omnibus chef repo
2014-05-01 16:36:41	+jordane	Yeah, I was looking at that yesterday
2014-05-01 16:36:49	+jordane	I just wish they had a kitchen ssh
2014-05-01 16:37:05	+Ramereth	doesn't kitchen login do that?
2014-05-01 16:37:29	+jordane	Huh. I must have missed when they added that
2014-05-01 16:37:36	+jordane	It's been a while since I've used kitchen much
2014-05-01 16:37:39	+jordane	nifty
2014-05-01 16:38:02	+jordane	heh. So I commented on that sqlite pull with a couple of suggested fixes
2014-05-01 16:38:07	+jordane	the author made them in < 2 minutes
2014-05-01 16:39:55	+Ramereth	heh

2014-05-02 09:42:19	+lrr	it's this annoying bug that I can't pin down. It only shows up if you'veodne a scripted pre-seed install
2014-05-02 09:42:29	+lrr	you've done*

2014-05-02 09:43:07	+Ramereth	why do you do it using the preseed approach anyways?
2014-05-02 09:43:11	+Ramereth	i was always confused by that
2014-05-02 09:43:18	+lrr	Ramereth: like, get a base debian kvm setup, login, apt-get install cloud-init
2014-05-02 09:43:46	+jordane	Ramereth: The build prefix only gets changed if you set $GWM_PREFIX
2014-05-02 09:43:47	+Ramereth	i.e. debconf-set-selections /tmp/packages-preseed.cfg <- that

2014-05-02 09:44:52	+jordane	Ramereth: ah. I was using it for testing because bundler + sudo + omnibus sometimes gets angry.

2014-05-05 09:19:58	+Ramereth	you probably could do that but you may have to work around a few things
2014-05-05 09:20:24	basic`	ok, worst case I think I can VPN in and do it, but it's just faster to not
2014-05-05 09:20:33	+Ramereth	they're just doing the testing today so you're probably ok-ish
2014-05-05 09:20:47	+Ramereth	i think they are just starting to get stuff setup

2014-05-05 09:50:51	bramwelt	So I'm testing debian on openstack, and nfs-homes is only exported to 10.1.0.0/23. Are there potential issues with adding an export to 10.1.100.0/23?
2014-05-05 09:52:02	+Ramereth	only that any openstack vm could mount it
2014-05-05 09:52:22	+Ramereth	but given that's only OSL'ers that shouldnt' be a problem

2014-05-05 13:42:49	chance	well it seems a patch for corbin's twisted websockets library fixes issues with chrome
2014-05-05 13:42:55	chance	and it works with FF at least for me
2014-05-05 13:43:00	+Ramereth	yay
2014-05-05 13:43:11	chance	so if i can get the patch merged in, and we can get txWS updated on pypy
2014-05-05 13:43:14	chance	pypi*
2014-05-05 13:43:34	chance	then we can update tvap on pypi and hopefully prod will see the fixes
2014-05-05 13:43:40	chance	after we upgrade it
2014-05-05 13:44:56	chance	just pmed corbin on irc to ask about it
2014-05-05 13:50:12	+bramwelt	Ramereth: To add an nfs export from nfs-homes, do I just add a line to /etc/exports, and run 'exportfs -a'? There aren't any docs on the wiki about nfs-homes.
2014-05-05 13:50:28	+Ramereth	is that host in chef? I can't remember
2014-05-05 13:50:31	+bramwelt	Yes
2014-05-05 13:50:42	+Ramereth	is that file managed by chef?
2014-05-05 13:50:46	+Ramereth	i mean that sounds about right
2014-05-05 13:51:10	+bramwelt	okay. I was going to quickly test it, and then add it to chef if it works.
2014-05-05 13:51:28	+Ramereth	there might be a reload command too
2014-05-05 13:51:33	+Ramereth	that does it for you
2014-05-05 13:51:41	chance	sounds like corbin will merge the patch for us into txWS :)
2014-05-05 13:52:03	+bramwelt	Yeah, that's 'exportfs -a' like 'mount -a'
2014-05-05 13:53:55	+bramwelt	Sweet, that worked.
2014-05-05 13:58:27	jordane	So this might be the funniest slide I've seen so far: https://twitter.com/ashedryden/status/463381046134702080/photo/1

2014-05-05 13:59:03	+edunham	i don't even... how's that related...
2014-05-05 13:59:26	+edunham	out of context, that makes me incredibly uncomfortable 'cause it seems like it's marginalizing half the population for an attribute of themselves they can't change
2014-05-05 13:59:30	+Ramereth	edunham: you have to see it in context
2014-05-05 13:59:33	+Ramereth	i briefly saw it
2014-05-05 13:59:45	+edunham	okay :)
2014-05-05 14:00:24	+Ramereth	but ya, that slide looks horrible out of context
2014-05-05 14:00:36	jordane	edunham: It was in the context of social engineering

2014-05-05 14:56:03	+edunham	pwnguin: yeah that thread ended on "EXPLAIN ALL THE THINGS RAWR" more or less
2014-05-05 14:56:25	+edunham	I guess the explanation of what's possible has changed, though
2014-05-05 14:56:43	+pwnguin	more or less at this point i'd say we plan to upgrade all sites to 2.6
2014-05-05 14:56:59	+pwnguin	which should address the 'updates available' thing
2014-05-05 14:57:16	+edunham	okay
2014-05-05 14:57:23	+edunham	when's that update planned for -- early summer?
2014-05-05 14:57:48	+pwnguin	i believe my notes say july
2014-05-05 15:00:08	+pwnguin	yes. last conf call with ORVSD staff we settled on a july upgrade window. to be refined when we have a better idea of whether moodle 2.7 will be ready
2014-05-05 15:00:17	+edunham	hmm ok

2014-05-06 14:06:03	 *	gchaix shakes a fist
2014-05-06 14:06:07	+Ramereth	finally made bundler happy on fedora ppc64
2014-05-06 14:06:16	+pono	Ramereth++
2014-05-06 14:06:18	+pono	What was the fix?
2014-05-06 14:06:22	+Ramereth	you're going to laugh
2014-05-06 14:06:36	gchaix	apply scotch liberally to developer?
2014-05-06 14:06:42	+Ramereth	when I ran config manually with openssl I got this:

2014-05-06 14:07:00	Jeff_S	gchaix: my recommendation is just grab it from Fedora and rebuild
2014-05-06 14:07:01	--	Notice(manatee): PROBLEM: store.centos/SSH is CRITICAL, Server answer:, May 06, 21:07 UTC
2014-05-06 14:07:07	+Ramereth	so I thought, well lets try with that setting and see if the tests pass
2014-05-06 14:07:09	Jeff_S	where it == SRPM
2014-05-06 14:07:29	+Ramereth	Jeff_S: BUT BUT FPM!!!
2014-05-06 14:07:34	gchaix	Jeff_S: yeah, I considered that but it's so damn simple and I need to roll it out via puppet
2014-05-06 14:07:38	Jeff_S	but ... REAL RPMs suck less
2014-05-06 14:07:42	+pono	Ramereth: Heh, so ./Configure fixed it?
2014-05-06 14:07:57	Jeff_S	gchaix: right, I mean rebulid that RPM instead of using FPM
2014-05-06 14:07:58	+irdan	pono: have you removed any of the unused databases from db1?
2014-05-06 14:08:06	+Ramereth	pono: yup, but then I discovered that omnibus needs to add support for "ppc64" for their architecture variable
2014-05-06 14:08:08	Jeff_S	cause you'll have something "more standard" and shit
2014-05-06 14:08:28	gchaix	'cuz we all need more "and shit" in our systems

2014-05-06 14:10:45	Jeff_S	gchaix: sure, but you can use that spec file and drop in the new version, should work
2014-05-06 14:10:53	Jeff_S	what's in 1.9.2 that you need?
2014-05-06 14:10:59	Jeff_S	bloody noses?
2014-05-06 14:10:59	+Ramereth	or you can just tell fpm to ./configure make make install ;)
2014-05-06 14:11:19	gchaix	more like if I'm going to do it, I might as well do the most recent stable release so I don't have to re-do it as soon
2014-05-06 14:11:22	 *	Jeff_S sends Ramereth back to his gentoos
2014-05-06 14:11:35	gchaix	OSuth African Gentoos? ;-)

2014-05-07 10:01:46	basic`	is anyone around that can check and see if lb2 has a backend network cable plugged in to the port next to the public interface?
2014-05-07 10:02:03	basic`	lb2.drupal
2014-05-07 10:19:54	+Ramereth	basic`: btw, today would not be a good day to work on your work. FYI. they are working on the cooling unit right in front of it
2014-05-07 10:20:19	basic`	ah, ok
2014-05-07 10:20:30	+Ramereth	but cable checking shouldn't be a problem in theory

2014-05-07 10:41:38	+armiller	basic`: so there is 4 nics on lb2. gb1 is public, gb2 is plugged into port 47 on the switch, and there is two other nics on what looks to be a pci card
2014-05-07 10:42:17	basic`	armiller: are those plugged in at all, the two other nics?
2014-05-07 10:42:50	basic`	two are intel, two are broadcom, i don't know which is which, something is funky
2014-05-07 10:43:05	basic`	thanks for checking, if there was a nic plugged in it's likely the second intel one, and we have something misconfigured
2014-05-07 10:45:33	basic`	armiller: is there a 3rd cable for oob?
2014-05-07 10:46:06	+armiller	basic`: let me check again.
2014-05-07 11:01:50	+armiller	Ramereth: I am going to work on haproxy to disable https for those sites
2014-05-07 11:02:29	+armiller	you responded while i was writing my response :)
2014-05-07 11:04:57	+Ramereth	armiller: ah ok. I wasn't sure what you could or couldn't with
2014-05-07 11:04:59	+Ramereth	it
2014-05-07 11:05:04	+Ramereth	sorry I jumped the gun
2014-05-07 11:05:20	+armiller	Ramereth: np. I think a redirect rule would be the easiest
2014-05-07 11:05:23	+Ramereth	the problem is a rewrite won't fix it
2014-05-07 11:05:27	+Ramereth	you'll still see a warning
2014-05-07 11:05:38	+Ramereth	that happens after the ssl connection is made
2014-05-07 11:05:46	+armiller	true...
2014-05-07 11:05:58	+armiller	I will look and see if I can just disable ssl for those sites
2014-05-07 11:08:33	basic`	armiller: that's a moodle setting, i think, if you're talking orvsd, and you can override the url and https through config.php on gluster
2014-05-07 11:09:08	+armiller	basic`: they want https disabled on their drupal sites. They get the wildcard cert when they connect to lb1. so it needs to be disabled on haproxy
2014-05-07 11:09:40	basic`	oh, like actually turn it off
2014-05-07 11:10:35	+Ramereth	i don't think its possible without using a different ip
2014-05-07 11:10:37	+armiller	basic`: yea, they are complaining that it makes them look bad to have a ssl warning on their site
2014-05-07 11:10:45	+Ramereth	or adding a cert
2014-05-07 11:11:05	basic`	SNI will let you add a cert, as long as they aren't using ie6
2014-05-07 11:11:34	+armiller	you can add logic in haproxy to block requests based on a regex but I don't know if that will stop the error on the browser
2014-05-07 11:12:45	+armiller	I can at leaset test it out on lb2 and see what heppens
2014-05-07 11:12:47	+armiller	*happens
2014-05-07 11:12:55	+armiller	but it would make sense for them to get their own cert
2014-05-07 11:13:10	+Ramereth	that would be the best solution IMO
2014-05-07 11:13:37	+armiller	that is what I said in my first response but I don't think bryan understands the issue
2014-05-07 11:14:48	+armiller	basic`: what is SNI?
2014-05-07 11:15:03	basic`	server name indication
2014-05-07 11:16:09	Jeff_S	basic`: actually any IE on WinXP :(
2014-05-07 11:16:17	Jeff_S	(sad I know that)
2014-05-07 11:17:07	basic`	Jeff_S: yep, that
2014-05-07 11:17:15	Jeff_S	but screw them ;)
2014-05-07 11:17:16	basic`	oh you can have ie7 on xp

2014-05-07 11:30:41	+pwnguin	armiller: there's probably one hooked up in dell26
2014-05-07 11:32:25	+Ramereth	well, i mean its probably a good idea to regularly find it and put it back somewhere
2014-05-07 11:33:51	jordane	and/or have a thing telling you where it is if not in its usual spot.

2014-05-08 09:17:14	+bramwelt	Packages takes > 15 minutes.
2014-05-08 09:25:12	+Ramereth	15 minutes?!
2014-05-08 09:25:20	+Ramereth	that seems a bit extreme
2014-05-08 09:31:24	+bramwelt	To install a giant list of packages?
2014-05-08 09:31:45	+Ramereth	yes. At that point it makes more sense to do the majority of that in a preseed and let chef still ensure they are there
2014-05-08 09:32:02	+Ramereth	at least doing the main stuff like the base desktop env

2014-05-08 09:33:28	+Ramereth	i wouldn't move everything there
2014-05-08 09:33:34	+bramwelt	Still need to writeup a new preseed. I have one in the works.

2014-05-09 14:23:53	+Ramereth	if you're talking about staging
2014-05-09 14:24:04	+jordane	Ramereth: yeah
2014-05-09 14:24:35	chance	man i want a new staging site so bad :|
2014-05-09 14:25:00	chance	virtualenv defaults to still using site-packages (pulls in global python install packages), no apt/yum, and just crufty overall
2014-05-09 14:25:30	+Ramereth	well, we need to make a new centos based chef vm to do it right
2014-05-09 14:25:36	+Ramereth	i'd rather have that setup
2014-05-09 14:25:42	+Ramereth	we don't need to stick to that machine
2014-05-09 14:26:48	chance	yeah
2014-05-09 14:34:13	+Ramereth	lrr: heads up, i think I'm going to work on redeploying powerkvm1 this afternoon
2014-05-09 14:35:01	+lrr	Ramereth: ok. i'm not using any of the powerkvm machines
2014-05-09 14:35:16	+Ramereth	i actually want to rename them to openpower# to align it
2014-05-09 14:35:25	+Ramereth	i'm also going to put in a request to get the vlan switched to the new one
2014-05-09 14:35:46	+Ramereth	does the x86 openstack have any public net plumbed to it?
2014-05-09 14:36:38	+lrr	Ramereth: otest2 is on vlan 109 iirc
2014-05-09 14:36:54	+lrr	but it's not on right now and we should get all the openstack nodes moved over the the new vlan
2014-05-09 14:43:08	chance	do you need to reload or restart apache when updating a vhost?

2014-05-09 14:46:08	+armiller	jordane: do you know whats going on with the chef server? http://munin2.osuosl.org/osuosl.org/chef.osuosl.org/memory.html
2014-05-09 14:46:10	manatee	armiller's tiny URL is http://bit.ly/1l9tWUI
2014-05-09 14:46:45	+jordane	armiller: is that behind an ldap wall? Or some other creds?
2014-05-09 14:46:50	+armiller	nagiosadmin/nagiosadmin
2014-05-09 14:47:00	+jordane	thx
2014-05-09 14:47:01	+armiller	we haven't moved to ldap yet for munin
2014-05-09 14:47:10	+armiller	...or nagios
2014-05-09 14:47:17	pwnguin	or racktables
2014-05-09 14:47:25	+jordane	Hmm. That's an interesting graph.
2014-05-09 14:49:39	+jordane	armiller: committed memory isn't too scary though.
2014-05-09 14:50:03	+jordane	armiller: it's basically the max memory you'd need to guarantee no OOMs without more malloc() calls
2014-05-09 14:50:31	+jordane	so each rise is an malloc() call, which may or may not end up making more memory actually used
2014-05-09 14:51:30	+armiller	the steady swap increase is more concerning to me. I believe it is still a depends issue on the chef server
2014-05-09 14:51:53	+jordane	Probably. I've been clearing out swatchs of cookbooks today to try and find it
2014-05-09 14:52:04	pwnguin	well
2014-05-09 14:52:10	pwnguin	there's 8 gb total right?
2014-05-09 14:52:20	+jordane	4GB ram + 4GB swap
2014-05-09 14:53:07	+jordane	armiller: the swap increase isn't really a worry unless the unused completely disappears
2014-05-09 14:53:27	pwnguin	i was going to argue that swap ought to grow with time logarithmically as the OS slowly decides it should swap out unused things for more cache
2014-05-09 14:53:42	+jordane	Yeah
2014-05-09 14:53:43	pwnguin	but the 'by year' chart shows a different story
2014-05-09 14:53:49	pwnguin	fairly linear
2014-05-09 14:54:44	+armiller	cpu usage by year shows a better example of the depends issue on the chef server.
2014-05-09 14:55:45	+Ramereth	can someone please go relabel the powerkvm# machines to openpower# ? (replacing # with their number)
2014-05-09 14:55:49	+Ramereth	and update inventory too?
2014-05-09 14:55:53	+Ramereth	i'm going to swap dns
2014-05-09 14:55:59	+jordane	armiller: I don't see cpu by year on munin

2014-05-09 14:57:31	+armiller	yep. Last time for me it was the php cookbook
2014-05-09 14:57:43	+jordane	I mean, I've found several already
2014-05-09 14:57:49	+jordane	just not all of them.

2014-05-09 15:30:39	+jordane	should be fixed once I roll everything up to yum 3.0

2014-05-09 15:46:43	+jordane	yeah, the vhost on port 80 isn't set up to log

2014-05-09 16:36:56	+Ramereth	you could have just use the wildcard cert we use

2014-05-09 16:37:20	chance	but yeah
2014-05-09 16:37:46	chance	well modern browsers wont let you use https and websockets if the websocket connection isnt encrypted
