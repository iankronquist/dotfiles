2014-05-21 11:16:09	@mythmon	edunham: "in their league" in what context?
2014-05-21 11:16:22	@mythmon	are we still talking about Magic, or general competition, or dating?
2014-05-21 11:16:45	@lrr	^^
2014-05-21 11:16:53	@mythmon	or something else.
2014-05-21 11:22:30	@edunham	sorry, total topic change, meant vaguely dating/socialization
2014-05-21 11:23:01	@mythmon	edunham: I suspected, but didn't want to go off on a tangent alone.
2014-05-21 11:23:37	@mythmon	i'm not bryon, and I don't have any sources, but I imagine that it is a comparison of the perceived attractiveness of the other person compared to one's own perceived attractiveness.
2014-05-21 11:24:19	@mythmon	so if you think you are unattractive (low self esteem?) you would think that someone who is more attractive than you is "out of your league"
2014-05-21 11:36:32	@edunham	mmhmm
2014-05-21 11:36:37	@edunham	but if leagues are like...
2014-05-21 11:36:50	@mythmon	they're fluid.
2014-05-21 11:37:00	@edunham	<least> |___leage A___|        |_League B__|       <most>
2014-05-21 11:37:07	@edunham	then isn't A out of B's league, too?
2014-05-21 11:37:18	@edunham	and yet that's never used as a retort
2014-05-21 11:37:27	@mythmon	sure it is.
2014-05-21 11:37:51	@mythmon	"I'm out of your league" can be used as a rejection.
2014-05-21 11:38:01	@mythmon	oh, wait.
2014-05-21 11:38:05	@mythmon	i got that backwards.
2014-05-21 11:38:11	@mythmon	"you're too good for me."
2014-05-21 11:38:12	@edunham	"you're out of my league"
2014-05-21 11:38:13	@mythmon	happens
2014-05-21 11:38:13	@edunham	yeah
2014-05-21 11:38:23	 *	edunham quietly rages about exactly that phenomenon
2014-05-21 11:38:57	@edunham	!fire edunham
2014-05-21 11:39:04	@edunham	way to humblebrag... but nah
2014-05-21 11:39:18	@edunham	it's just a way of viewing the universe that seems pretty thoroughly disconnected from reality
2014-05-21 11:39:32	@edunham	so I wondered if there's some underlying sociological logic to how it actually works
2014-05-21 11:41:37	@edunham	idk like... there oughtta be an objective measure of determining which groups of people are "in the same league"
2014-05-21 11:41:46	@edunham	it'd make everything make so much more sense :3
2014-05-21 11:41:52	 *	edunham contemplates how to automate this
2014-05-21 11:42:01	@edunham	facial symmetry + good grammar, perhaps?
2014-05-21 11:42:18	@lrr	edunham: the problem is, the subject you're talking about is a manifestation of people's securities and need to judge ourselves based upon the perception of others around them
2014-05-21 11:42:29	@lrr	s/securities/insecurities
2014-05-21 11:42:56	@lrr	there is no objectiveness about that
2014-05-21 11:42:59	@edunham	agreed
2014-05-21 11:43:36	@edunham	err, i typed that before the line about no objectiveness
2014-05-21 11:44:01	@lrr	i think i used to correct word?
2014-05-21 11:44:35	@edunham	uhh... yeah, being objective would mean that everyone uses the same standards

2014-05-21 11:44:50	@lrr	lol
2014-05-21 11:44:58	@edunham	nah, nothing enforces an internally consistent system
2014-05-21 11:44:59	@edunham	drat
2014-05-21 12:10:23	@mythmon	also things like reputation, affluence, and power play into the system too
2014-05-21 12:10:29	@mythmon	not just physical attractiveness.
2014-05-21 12:13:46	@bryon	i am late to the "out of my league" disicussion, but it seems to have been covered
2014-05-21 12:14:38	@bryon	The only thing I have left to offer is to refer you to this 2010 documentary that extensively examines this exact topic: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815236/

2014-05-21 17:15:02	@bryon	his approach MIGHT have been useful, but in my experience, it's rarely helpful to have more than way of doing things presented to you as you're learning

2014-05-21 17:17:23	@edunham	I pm'd him about the debate tactic of rephrasing the opponent's point before refuting it
2014-05-21 17:17:54	@edunham	I've had good experiences with him taking interpersonal-stuff criticism and applying it to change his behavior in the past, believe it or not
2014-05-21 17:17:58	@edunham	so who knows... might help
2014-05-21 17:18:29	@edunham	and like... he's been doing this long enough to be pretty damn knowledgeable in his areas of expertise, but that knowledge can only help others if he can communicate it well
2014-05-21 17:18:53	@bryon	yup
2014-05-21 17:19:40	@bryon	what blows my mind is how we can be in a meeting (or wherever) and someone will ask a question, and he'll jump in to answer it

2014-05-24 13:02:21	@jnoah	took the airforce and marriage to calm my friend down...so, maybe this summer will help?
2014-05-24 13:02:45	@bryon	lol, the idea of chance going through basic training
2014-05-24 13:03:16	@mythmon	O_O
2014-05-24 13:04:25	@jnoah	heh
2014-05-24 13:08:33	@jnoah	i'm guessing data roaming charges start accross the border :(

2014-05-24 13:11:50	@mythmon	airplane+wifi is your wallet's friend.
2014-05-24 13:13:30	@bryon	just put some in your pocket
2014-05-24 13:13:44	@jnoah	i don't get how people can use touchscrren keyboards..... these are so annoying to use. :/ (nook color w/cm)
2014-05-24 13:14:22	@mythmon	jnoah: some keyboards are better than others.
2014-05-24 13:15:22	@mythmon	for example, i've found Touchpal X to be very nice, because there is a one-gesture way to turn off autocomplete.
2014-05-24 13:15:26	@mythmon	great for ssh or irc.
2014-05-24 13:15:57	@jnoah	ah, no autocomplete here, but i like feedback
2014-05-24 13:16:01	@mythmon	ah
2014-05-24 13:16:32	@mythmon	yeah, it can be hard to figure out how to type without tactile feedback.
2014-05-24 13:16:44	@mythmon	haptic/audio can help a little, but it's still hard to type well.
2014-05-24 13:21:14	@jnoah	yeah, i like typing without looking at the keyboard....as we were taught when younger
2014-05-24 13:22:15	@mythmon	i couldn't even do that on my blackberry.
2014-05-24 13:22:27	@mythmon	my touch typing isn't so precise as that.
2014-05-24 13:22:40	@mythmon	(i mention blackberry because they famously had very good physical keyboards)

2014-05-24 14:11:29	@hamper	mythmon: Ask again later.
2014-05-24 14:11:35	@mythmon	*ugh*
2014-05-24 14:45:07	@bryon	at least hamper wasn't thinking about bananas
2014-05-24 14:48:27	@mythmon	yeah. i don't have any bananas.
2014-05-24 15:20:50	@lucyw	All:  I'm unsure of how to feel about chance...he's really nice to me personally, but a total dick to most of the people I know.
2014-05-24 15:21:50	@mythmon	lucyw: do you think he is actively being a dick, or is he just not realized his behavior is not good?
2014-05-24 15:24:08	@lucyw	mythmon: the latter; I don't think he does it *to* be a dick, he just has some not-fun character flaws.
2014-05-24 15:24:38	@lucyw	That doesn't really make it ok, or any easier to deal with though :/
2014-05-24 15:25:32	@mythmon	lucyw: yeah.
2014-05-24 15:25:48	@mythmon	lucyw: why do you think he is nice to you?
2014-05-24 15:27:14	@mythmon	I don't really know chance that well.
2014-05-24 15:28:40	@lucyw	That I'm less sure of, and it's always a pleasant surprise.  It could be because I don't seem "intellectually threatening" (putting that in the vault of phrases I hope to never have to use again) to him.  It could be that I'm a girl (although he doesn't seem to be as nice to Em, so perhaps not).
2014-05-24 15:29:28	@mythmon	i would be disappointed if either of those were the case.
2014-05-24 15:30:00	@lucyw	You're working with him this summer, yeah?
2014-05-24 15:30:15	@mythmon	not really
2014-05-24 15:30:34	@mythmon	he is going to be at mozilla, but he will be in San Francisco, not Mountain View (where I am) and on an entirely different team.
2014-05-24 15:30:41	@mythmon	I'm sure I'll see him, but not often.
2014-05-24 15:30:58	@lucyw	Ah, ok. I was under the impression that he and muricula were working under you/within a team you were part of.
2014-05-24 15:31:13	@mythmon	nope. that's muricula and deanj
2014-05-24 15:32:14	@mythmon	i'll also have a lot of interaction with bramwelt. We won't be on the same team, but his desk is going to be right next to mine, and I'm friends with his mentor.
2014-05-24 15:32:47	@mythmon	iirc, chance will be working on the services team.
2014-05-24 15:32:49	@lucyw	that's going to be awesome :)  bramwelt is a wonderful human
2014-05-24 15:33:17	@mythmon	I'm excited.

2014-05-25 09:41:31	@deanj	bramwelt++
2014-05-25 09:44:28	@deanj	And yeah, he can definitely be a dick, but I think it's more related to the reason he can't accept being wrong. A quick fix I've found that works with him though, is letting him finish his thought and calmly reminding him let you finish your thoughts if he tries to interject. If you're ever in an argument with him and it seems like it's going nowhere, just tell him that you understand we have different
2014-05-25 09:44:30	@deanj	opinions and we should just leave it at that.

2014-05-26 22:19:06	@hamper	edunham: Without a doubt.
2014-05-26 22:19:09	@mythmon	hamper: a fresh one from scratch?
2014-05-26 22:19:09	@hamper	mythmon: No. No, I don't think so.
2014-05-26 22:19:16	@mythmon	hamper: a fork?
2014-05-26 22:19:17	@hamper	mythmon: Without a doubt.
2014-05-26 22:30:45	@chekkaa	edunham: both you at jnoah called it "tac" at the last lug
2014-05-26 22:30:57	@chekkaa	and I was really confused
2014-05-26 22:31:00	@edunham	haha ok
2014-05-26 22:31:05	@edunham	so wade is just contagious
2014-05-26 22:31:23	@edunham	I only call it tac when referring to arguments given to a script
2014-05-26 22:31:28	@chekkaa	ah
2014-05-26 22:31:31	 *	jnoah used it before wade (darren on hak5 used (may still) to use it)
2014-05-26 22:32:36	@mythmon	sometimes i'll pronounce it "flag" when talking about arguments.
2014-05-26 22:32:42	@mythmon	though I think that confuses most people.
2014-05-26 22:34:01	@chekkaa	also, (smoked tea)++
2014-05-26 22:34:14	@chekkaa	I picked some of it up the other day at tao of tea
2014-05-26 22:34:15	@Alan_S	my cs teacher in high school was ex milltary and always called it 'tac'
2014-05-26 22:38:10	@mythmon	edunham: so, back on weechat?
2014-05-26 22:38:14	@mythmon	er, back on irssi?
2014-05-26 22:38:22	@edunham	mythmon: ypu
2014-05-26 22:38:24	@edunham	*yup
2014-05-26 22:38:26	@mythmon	:(
2014-05-26 22:38:28	@edunham	it's slightly less hideous
2014-05-26 22:38:33	@edunham	especially just out of the box
2014-05-26 22:38:47	@mythmon	imo they are both pretty nasty out of the box, but ok.
2014-05-26 22:39:11	@edunham	ehh, irsssi doesn't do eye-burney colors
2014-05-26 22:39:17	@edunham	with much hacking required to make it stop
2014-05-26 22:39:33	@mythmon	in fact...
2014-05-26 22:39:44	@edunham	mythmon++ for walking me through the hacking required to make the sidebar stop
2014-05-26 22:39:49	@edunham	but still, the hacking was required.

2014-05-26 22:40:49	@mythmon	they both look about the same
2014-05-26 22:40:54	@mythmon	except the nicklist
2014-05-26 22:41:23	@edunham	mythmon1, mythmon_ look at your highlights

2014-05-26 22:41:51	@chekkaa	I just hide the nicklist if the weechat screen is less than 100 chars wide
2014-05-26 22:41:52	@mythmon	well, weechat has better highlight behavior out of the box.
2014-05-26 22:41:56	@chekkaa	and it shows in fullscreen
2014-05-26 22:42:00	@mythmon	chekkaa: you got that from me.
2014-05-26 22:42:01	@mythmon	yes?
2014-05-26 22:42:01	@hamper	mythmon: no.
2014-05-26 22:42:14	@chekkaa	mythmon: quite possibly
2014-05-26 22:42:20	@jnoah	mythmon: i know i did :)
2014-05-26 22:42:22	@chekkaa	I don't remember
2014-05-26 22:42:23	@jnoah	it's great
2014-05-26 22:42:34	@chekkaa	you probably told me
2014-05-26 22:42:37	@chekkaa	and I ignored it
2014-05-26 22:42:44	@chekkaa	then I found it in the settings like a week ago
2014-05-26 22:42:46	@mythmon	heh
2014-05-26 22:43:06	@mythmon	edunham: the colors of weechat's default highlights are poorly chosen, i will admit.
2014-05-26 22:43:24	@edunham	they hurt my eyes :c

2014-05-26 22:44:27	@chekkaa	the channel shows up as dark purple for me when pinged
2014-05-26 22:44:29	@mythmon	ha. finally got my screenshotter to work again http://i.imgur.com/8Zi8X4V.png
2014-05-26 22:44:40	@chekkaa	I think I have a nonstandard color scheme

2014-05-26 22:45:00	@mythmon	also, my screen is *full* of irc right now.

2014-05-26 22:48:31	@chekkaa	I'll probably be around
2014-05-26 22:49:05	@edunham	mythmon: coming up to pdx?
2014-05-26 22:49:15	@mythmon	edunham: yeah.
2014-05-26 22:49:39	@mythmon	the goal is to scope out general neighborhoods so when it comes down to detailed apartment hunting i'll know more.
2014-05-26 22:49:50	@mythmon	the reason for the trip is relud's wedding.
2014-05-26 22:49:58	@mythmon	but i'll be spending some time in portland.

2014-05-26 22:50:23	@mythmon	chekkaa: later.
2014-05-26 22:50:54	@chekkaa	mythmon: for what reason, if I may ask?
2014-05-26 22:51:01	@mythmon	chekkaa: the bay is fucking expensive.
2014-05-26 22:51:04	@mythmon	plus, i like you guys.

2014-05-27 05:09:32	@chekkaa	if anyone asks, I was disconnected from the Internet for 48 contiguous hours this weekend for that internet addiction paper
2014-05-27 05:09:47	@chekkaa	and by anyone, I mean carlos
2014-05-27 07:36:53	@edunham	chekkaa: haha, but you were too addicted to actually?
2014-05-27 07:36:59	@edunham	nah, I didn't see you in any channels for a couple days
2014-05-27 07:51:35	@chekkaa	I'm not addicted
2014-05-27 07:51:40	@chekkaa	I could stop
2014-05-27 07:51:44	@chekkaa	I just don't want to
2014-05-27 07:51:46	@chekkaa	:P
2014-05-27 08:08:18	@edunham	I'd say we should stage an intervention
2014-05-27 08:08:20	@edunham	but it'd be online
2014-05-27 08:18:49	@lucyw	chekkaa: do you sleep?

2014-05-27 09:07:34	@Alan_S	edunham: I should really get around to finishing my weechat guide, it really does need some tuning out of the box
2014-05-27 09:11:30	@mythmon	i wonder if we could get the defaults changed.
2014-05-27 09:17:21	@edunham	Alan_S: doooo eeet
2014-05-27 09:17:31	@edunham	bonus points if you push a .weechat repo to the lug gh org
2014-05-27 09:17:37	@edunham	so the guide goes
2014-05-27 09:17:44	@edunham	1) clone this into .weechat
2014-05-27 09:17:49	@edunham	2) $ weechat
2014-05-27 09:17:57	@edunham	3) no questionmarks, it JUST WORKS
2014-05-27 09:19:14	@Alan_S	hmm, I could do that just get everyone to use my weechat settings ;)
2014-05-27 09:20:04	@edunham	dude the entire goal is "settings that don't suck"
2014-05-27 09:20:12	@edunham	if your settings don't suck, you're accomplishing the goal
2014-05-27 09:20:37	 *	edunham would wager that they became your setting when you copied them from someone else's settings anyway
2014-05-27 13:21:57	@chekkaa	so about that sleep thing

2014-05-27 22:58:00	@mythmon	well, you heard the bot
2014-05-27 22:58:03	@jnoah	mythmon: you may want machine learning for that rather than strict probabilities
2014-05-27 22:58:27	@jnoah	mythmon: hamper should have asked, have you had enough to drink yet?
2014-05-27 22:58:27	@mythmon	jnoah: i think we have different ideas of what "machine learning" means.
2014-05-27 22:58:49	@jnoah	mythmon: adjust probabilities based on input and meaning
2014-05-27 22:59:43	@jnoah	it would have to most likely be supervised learning
2014-05-27 22:59:49	@jnoah	based on log data
2014-05-27 23:00:27	@mythmon	that's weird, because i heard something like http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/

2014-05-27 23:02:43	@mythmon	if there was a good way to give feedback to the bot about "that was good" "that was bad", then it's pretty simple bayesian stuff. but that seems like too much metawork to me.
2014-05-27 23:02:48	@jnoah	i want to get started on a machine learning project
2014-05-27 23:26:42	@mythmon	"If you can think of any character who isn't dead, please let me know, this is probably a continuity error."

2014-05-28 10:43:44	@chekkaa	how so?
2014-05-28 10:43:56	@chekkaa	I feel like it covers most of the important stuff
2014-05-28 10:44:00	@chekkaa	but ianal
2014-05-28 10:44:00	@edunham	lawyer things
2014-05-28 10:44:02	@edunham	ya
2014-05-28 10:44:04	@edunham	lawyers--
2014-05-28 10:44:42	@chekkaa	it doesn't have a lot of restrictions or stipulations
2014-05-28 10:44:48	@chekkaa	so it doesn't need to be very long
2014-05-28 10:48:29	@jnoah	it doesn't specify enough
2014-05-28 10:48:37	@jnoah	in lawyer terms it's too vague
2014-05-28 10:49:47	@jnoah	the speaker didn't 'recommend' a license to use, but he thought the apache, for most cases, was a good license
2014-05-28 10:50:04	@mythmon	but apache is soooo long </whine>
2014-05-28 10:50:15	@jnoah	that's the point
2014-05-28 10:50:24	@jnoah	it defines actions, restrictions, etc
2014-05-28 10:50:28	@mythmon	*grump*
2014-05-28 10:51:05	@jnoah	i think i'm going to give the apachev2 a read, and if i like, i'll prolly start using it
2014-05-28 10:51:35	@chekkaa	jnoah: what do you use currently?
2014-05-28 10:51:51	@jnoah	mit usually
2014-05-28 10:52:00	@chekkaa	is it possible to just change the license of a project?
2014-05-28 10:52:02	@jnoah	i like bsd 3clause as well
2014-05-28 10:52:04	@jnoah	or did
2014-05-28 10:52:10	@jnoah	yes
2014-05-28 10:52:15	@jnoah	ish
2014-05-28 10:53:31	@jnoah	i beleive you just need (i say just, while in a huge project this can be a problem) to have all authors agree in manner to relicense their code. I dunno how it's done legally tight though.
2014-05-28 10:53:49	@jnoah	If it's your own project...you are the only author...just change it :)
2014-05-28 10:54:40	@jnoah	though any commit prior to the license change will probably fall under the previous license. I'm not 100% sure on that though, I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advise
2014-05-28 10:54:40	@chekkaa	I thought that only some licenses allow switching
2014-05-28 10:54:45	@jnoah	advice*
2014-05-28 10:55:23	@jnoah	i'm not too sure on the specifics
2014-05-28 10:55:35	@jnoah	i know in some cases it's possible, unsure about all
2014-05-28 10:55:35	@mythmon	as an author, you can always apply a new license.
2014-05-28 10:55:38	@mythmon	to your own code.
2014-05-28 10:55:44	@jnoah	iircyeah
2014-05-28 10:55:48	@jnoah	yeah*
2014-05-28 10:55:55	@mythmon	some licenses can be "upgraded"
2014-05-28 10:56:21	@mythmon	like, iirc, GPLv1 code can be "upgraded" to GPLv2
2014-05-28 10:56:23	@jnoah	mit -> apache can
2014-05-28 11:02:31	@chekkaa	to change the topic, why are static element toolbars becoming a thing

2014-05-28 17:34:13	@mythmon	kind of how you ssh to anything with putty?
2014-05-28 17:34:19	perhapsbryon	i'm stuck on a windows machine and it keeps telling me "No supported authentication methods available"
2014-05-28 17:34:23	@mythmon	oh.
2014-05-28 17:34:29	@mythmon	I bet ash only supports key login.
2014-05-28 17:34:58	perhapsbryon	well, there is a place to specify a key for authentication, and i have specified my key in that place
2014-05-28 17:35:16	perhapsbryon	but it is apparently not working somehow
2014-05-28 17:35:31	perhapsbryon	it doesn't say "wrong key" or even ask for my passphrase
2014-05-28 17:35:34	@mythmon	perhapsbryon: putty doesn't use the same kind of keys as openssh.
2014-05-28 17:35:42	perhapsbryon	just immediately disconnects with the above error
2014-05-28 17:35:46	@mythmon	it stores them in a different format.
2014-05-28 17:36:00	@mythmon	so it's probably erroring out and not trying key auth.
2014-05-28 17:36:15	@mythmon	also, this is an odd channel for text support :)
2014-05-28 17:36:59	perhapsbryon	yeah, i know

2014-05-29 11:11:42	@edunham	ehh it parsed
2014-05-29 11:15:31	@mythmon	if you use "bed" as a verb meaning "to go to bed to sleep", and allow for implicit nouns, that seems like fine english.
2014-05-29 11:16:01	@mythmon	oh. and implict tense.
2014-05-29 11:16:09	@mythmon	clearly we all just need to speak lojban.

2014-05-30 23:16:42	@bryon	i don't even bother with those
2014-05-30 23:17:52	@jnoah	TS is basically CAM, but generally done with better equipment. no scene group does a true TS these days
2014-05-30 23:18:37	@jnoah	The true definition of telesync would include the film being synchronized to the camera's own frame rate and shutter timing as done by television companies when preparing celluloid film for broadcast. A bootleg TS rarely, if ever, uses this form of synchronisation which can lead to additional temporal aliasing. A TS uses cam video with better-quality audio.

2014-06-01 21:04:44	@bryon	was that in cheba hut?
2014-06-01 21:04:55	@bryon	i just thought of it
2014-06-01 21:13:13	@mythmon	it was
2014-06-01 21:13:17	@mythmon	or something like it
2014-06-01 21:13:20	@bryon	ah
2014-06-01 21:13:30	@bryon	i think i've been to cheba hut like 2 times
2014-06-01 21:13:47	@bryon	decent sandwiches
2014-06-01 21:14:05	@bryon	the thinly veiled weed theme amused me
2014-06-01 21:14:23	@mythmon	it was thinly veiled?
2014-06-01 21:14:51	@bryon	sufficiently thinly so to as be effectively not veiled at all
2014-06-01 21:43:43	edunham	veiled like those hot chicks' bodies were veiled by paint, perhaps.
2014-06-01 21:44:48	@bryon	pretty much
2014-06-01 22:07:08	@mythmon	i always find it odd when some people are ok being seen with just paint, but not naked-without-paint.
2014-06-01 22:07:54	edunham	well, the optical illusions of paint can modify one's apparent contours
2014-06-01 22:08:07	edunham	and really there's not a huge difference between, say, a bikini or yoga pants, and just paint
2014-06-01 22:08:21	@mythmon	hmm. true.
2014-06-01 22:12:52	@mythmon	I'm mainly thinking of things like this photoshoot.  (nsfw) http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Kate-Upton-bodypaint--e1360601783921.jpg
2014-06-01 22:13:22	@mythmon	that model refused to pose nude, and did for sometime after that (possible persisting in to the future)
2014-06-01 22:13:31	@mythmon	but that photo is basically her nude.
2014-06-01 22:15:24	@lucyw	Well, there's not a lot of difference between bikini and naked in the first place.
2014-06-01 22:15:51	@mythmon	right.
2014-06-01 22:16:14	@mythmon	what i'm talking about is why the line is drawn between being nude and being painted on and being nude and not being painted on.
2014-06-01 22:16:21	@mythmon	it seems like a strange place to put the line.
2014-06-01 22:16:42	@lucyw	mythmon: Ack, sorry!  Responding to edunham's last post.  I didn't see Kate Upton till just now
2014-06-01 22:16:49	@mythmon	oh, ok.
2014-06-01 22:17:57	@lucyw	mythmon: definitely a strange place to put the line.

2014-06-04 10:02:04	@edunham	deanj: pay attention to this part
2014-06-04 10:02:11	@edunham	unless you already know about timing attacks
2014-06-04 10:14:57	@edunham	deanj: doing useless no-ops when a test failed compensates for the fact that that many operations would've been done if the test had succeeded
2014-06-04 10:15:19	@edunham	thus the power usage and time are more similar between guesses with different amounts of correctness
2014-06-04 10:15:41	@edunham	if it fails out when the first character of a password is wrong, and fails out later if the first 5 chars are right
2014-06-04 10:15:57	@edunham	you can use timing attacks to deduce when you have a password or hash partially correct
2014-06-04 10:16:03	@edunham	this is actually a serious problem in cryptography
2014-06-04 10:16:25	@edunham	he's not explaining it the best -- i've heard it discussed better in terms of hash comparison
2014-06-04 10:16:28	@deanj	edunham: I saw how the timing attack worked, it was pretty cool. Oh, so it's basically helping accuracy by adding more time into each check against the password?
2014-06-04 10:16:49	@edunham	and power attacks work on the same principle of timing, yeah.
2014-06-04 10:16:57	@deanj	Ah, ok. Thanks! :D

2014-06-04 20:28:07	@edunham	mmm, that sounds tasty
2014-06-04 20:28:19	@edunham	I wonder which bottle of liquor would go best with chocolate icecream

2014-06-04 20:29:37	@bryon	fun fact: The waiter, "Buddy Holly" is portrayed by the inimitable Steve Buscemi
2014-06-04 20:31:34	@bryon	also, many people subscribe to the idea that "Fox Force Five" is an allusion to Kill Bill
2014-06-04 20:32:04	@bryon	http://imgur.com/gallery/HbmJS
2014-06-04 20:40:53	@lrr	yeah i knew the waiter was Steve buscemi
2014-06-04 20:41:40	@lrr	also this bourbon goes extremely well in just about any bourbon drink you can think of
2014-06-04 20:42:09	@edunham	lrr: no really?
2014-06-04 20:42:14	@edunham	bourbon going well in bourbon drinks??
2014-06-04 20:42:18	@edunham	also which brand?
2014-06-04 20:42:28	@jnoah	lolol
2014-06-04 20:43:02	@lrr	edunham: i am pleasantly surprised by the bourbon i bought
2014-06-04 20:43:15	@jnoah	a coworker of my dad's made is own bourbon and gave my dad a bottle. i wish i knew his process because it was some of the best whiskey i think i've ever had
2014-06-04 20:43:45	@edunham	lrr: ja, but what sort?
2014-06-04 20:44:08	@jnoah	lrr: brand?
2014-06-04 20:44:09	@lrr	edunham: lexington is the brand, currently on sale for ~$20
2014-06-04 20:44:29	@lrr	usually ~$30
2014-06-04 20:44:53	@jnoah	but it's a mixing bourbon, yes?
2014-06-04 20:45:00	@jnoah	(i would assume so for that price)
2014-06-04 20:45:05	@lrr	also this is the first time I'm watching pulp fiction.
2014-06-04 20:45:19	 *	mythmon ponders if he should turn off the bourbon highlight.
2014-06-04 20:45:33	@jnoah	lol
2014-06-04 20:45:37	@jnoah	lrr: REALLY?
2014-06-04 20:45:43	@lrr	jnoah: nor sure. i'm not connoisseur
2014-06-04 20:45:43	@jnoah	it's a fantastic movie
2014-06-04 20:45:59	@lrr	so far it's good
2014-06-04 20:46:11	@jnoah	i'm considering watching the movie again now. i haven't seen it in a long while
2014-06-04 20:46:36	@lrr	a little cheesy with the tensions but that's what 1994 gets you.
2014-06-04 20:47:18	@bryon	pulp fiction is a great flick, from multiple perspectives
2014-06-04 20:47:18	@lrr	mythmon: why do you highlight in bourbon?
2014-06-04 20:47:42	@bryon	lrr: why don't you?
2014-06-04 20:47:47	@lrr	s/tensions/transitions/
2014-06-04 20:47:47	@hamper	lrr actually meant: a little cheesy with the transitions but that's what 1994 gets you.
2014-06-04 20:48:03	@lrr	bryon: lol
2014-06-04 20:48:16	@mythmon	lrr: at one point in time, possibly to this day, there's a group that treats bourbon as a mass highlight.
2014-06-04 20:48:26	@lrr	hehe
2014-06-04 20:48:35	@mythmon	the entire group sets it as a highlight, for times when they really need to get everyone's attention.
2014-06-04 20:48:42	@lrr	lol
2014-06-04 20:49:23	@lrr	for me it's almost a hard alcohol i could drunk straight.
2014-06-04 20:49:34	@lrr	(the bourbon i bought)
2014-06-04 20:49:36	@mythmon	either something is on fire, and everyone needs to know, or someone is drinking, and everyone wants to know.
2014-06-04 20:49:45	@lrr	lol

2014-06-04 20:50:32	@bryon	pffft, no liquor is worth a minus?
2014-06-04 20:50:38	@lrr	(for not having liquor)
2014-06-04 20:50:48	@lrr	and spelling
2014-06-04 20:50:57	@bryon	ok, i'll take it for the spelling
2014-06-04 20:50:59	@bryon	=]
2014-06-04 20:51:13	@lrr	i assign it for the combo of both
2014-06-04 20:51:28	@bryon	i mean...  i have beer and wine
2014-06-04 20:51:30	@lrr	unless the first reason is an issue

2014-06-04 20:56:09	@edunham	bryon: I should get a flask.
2014-06-04 20:56:25	@edunham	But the only times I remember that I want a flask are when I'm about to head out to my parents' house
2014-06-04 20:56:29	@bryon	they're pretty great for a multitude of occasions
2014-06-04 20:56:39	@bryon	not the least of which is going to your parents' ouse
2014-06-04 20:56:43	@bryon	+h
2014-06-04 20:56:43	@edunham	I think it'd be uncouth to bring a bottle, but I also think it'd be delightful to hike into the woods and enjoy a drink while watching the sunset...
2014-06-04 20:57:23	@bryon	Bring a bottle one time, then bury it at your favorite sunset spot
2014-06-04 20:58:03	@edunham	oooooh

2014-06-04 21:01:16	@bryon	fragile shellac records instead of comparatively sturdier vinyl
2014-06-04 21:03:04	@bryon	lol, found a FAQ for victrola...  one of the questions is: Q.  The turntable spins, but the sound is terrible. What could be the problem?
2014-06-04 21:03:28	@bryon	surprisingly, the answer is not: "Dude, it's a Victrola. Even at its best quality, it sounds like ass."

2014-06-04 22:17:07	@bryon	i always had a bit of a fan crush on her
2014-06-04 22:17:12	@jnoah	mythmon++
2014-06-04 22:17:45	@bryon	I tolerated that PanAm show because she was in it
2014-06-04 22:18:13	@bryon	(the presence of Margot Robbie didn't hurt either)
2014-06-04 22:18:15	@jnoah	i saw the first ep of it...wait...no, just the trailer
2014-06-04 22:18:33	@jnoah	i'm guessing it's not a good show though?
2014-06-04 22:18:34	@bryon	it wasn't a HORRIBLE show
2014-06-04 22:18:37	@edunham	mythmon: ooooh, nice
2014-06-04 22:18:39	@bryon	it had a lot of potential
2014-06-04 22:18:49	 *	edunham acquiring a distinct fondness for that Quinn lady
2014-06-04 22:19:02	@bryon	she is baaaaatshiiiiit

2014-06-04 22:19:44	@edunham	don't apologize
2014-06-04 22:19:53	@edunham	also all I'd need is a packet of indigo, and I could do that hair
2014-06-04 22:20:15	@jnoah	mmm, you'd need to change your red
2014-06-04 22:20:20	@jnoah	it's not the same

2014-06-04 22:20:48	@bryon	just invert her motley
2014-06-04 22:20:56	@edunham	also she should have split red/black panties in mythmon's link
2014-06-04 22:20:56	@mythmon	hmm?
2014-06-04 22:20:59	@edunham	everything else is split
2014-06-04 22:21:03	@edunham	mythmon: I have red hair now
2014-06-04 22:21:11	@mythmon	edunham: those are hard enough to get.
2014-06-04 22:21:21	@mythmon	s/enough //
2014-06-04 22:21:21	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: edunham: those are hard to get.
2014-06-04 22:21:22	@edunham	also good gods her left wrist is SKELETAL
2014-06-04 22:21:27	@mythmon	sorry, my "hmm" was about "reverse motely"
2014-06-04 22:21:28	@edunham	look at it
2014-06-04 22:21:29	@edunham	terrifying
2014-06-04 22:21:30	@edunham	oh
2014-06-04 22:21:56	@bryon	mythmon: that was a joke
2014-06-04 22:21:57	@mythmon	i'm going to assume that left wrist is just at the minimum cross section angle...
2014-06-04 22:22:03	@bryon	because she would look effectively the same
2014-06-04 22:22:04	@mythmon	bryon: i'm not even sure what it means.

2014-06-04 22:53:54	@mythmon	well, OS selection, yes.
2014-06-04 22:54:01	@mythmon	but not the openness or api stand point.
2014-06-04 22:54:04	@chekkaa	I don't know why they even bother with drm
2014-06-04 22:54:07	@jnoah	that's true
2014-06-04 22:54:12	@chekkaa	netflix + screencap program
2014-06-04 22:54:14	@chekkaa	derp
2014-06-04 22:54:24	@jnoah	ew
2014-06-04 22:54:25	@mythmon	chekkaa: because most people won't do that.
2014-06-04 22:54:33	@mythmon	drm is like bike locks.
2014-06-04 22:54:42	@chekkaa	fair enough
2014-06-04 22:54:45	@mythmon	it won't stop a determined theif at all, but it deters casual theft.
2014-06-04 22:54:49	@jnoah	that's how i watched orange is the new black...the person screen capping bumped their mouse a few times.
2014-06-04 22:54:55	@chekkaa	but only one person has to do it
2014-06-04 22:55:01	@chekkaa	then they upload it
2014-06-04 22:55:04	@jnoah	sadly, i had netflix at the time...i just chose not to use it
2014-06-04 22:55:08	@chekkaa	to a torrent site
2014-06-04 22:55:09	@mythmon	chekkaa: anyways, filter bubble is the idea that you choose to surround yourself with people with similar world views.
2014-06-04 22:55:12	@bryon	mythmon: that's why i love my car
2014-06-04 22:55:20	@bryon	where love = lock
2014-06-04 22:55:44	@mythmon	and the the information in your life is filtered by those people (and the sources you tune into)
2014-06-04 22:56:02	@chekkaa	yeah, makes sense
2014-06-04 22:56:32	@mythmon	so, for example, i learn about tv shows and movies mainly through my friends and coworkers. most of them are tech people, and so often use netflix.
2014-06-04 22:56:55	@mythmon	they don't watch (and therefore talk about) shows that aren't on netflix. therefore what i want to watch is on netflix.
2014-06-04 22:56:58	@mythmon	approximately.
2014-06-04 22:57:02	@bryon	makes sense
2014-06-04 22:57:15	@jnoah	huh: //www.thefreedictionary.com/motley
2014-06-04 22:57:18	@jnoah	oops
2014-06-04 22:57:24	@jnoah	http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTQzODk *
2014-06-04 22:57:25	@mythmon	in a more sinister example, most of the people in my life are not victims of abuse, therefore my perception is that abuse is not a serious problem
2014-06-04 22:57:40	@mythmon	jnoah: compare to Hulu.
2014-06-04 22:57:49	@bryon	* > hulu
2014-06-04 22:57:50	@mythmon	for Hulu, I can get a XBMC plugin that plays content from Hulu.
2014-06-04 22:58:00	@bryon	but i still use hulu
2014-06-04 22:58:01	@mythmon	also, Amazon Prime video can do that.
2014-06-04 22:58:15	@bryon	how is amazon prime's selection
2014-06-04 22:58:22	@mythmon	idk
2014-06-04 22:58:40	@mythmon	i actually don't use it because the xbmc ui was pretty shitty.
2014-06-04 22:58:46	@bryon	ah
2014-06-04 22:58:48	@jnoah	oh hey...i have amazon prime. i've had it since about xmas time... is the selection any good there?
2014-06-04 22:58:54	 *	lrr is for bed
2014-06-04 22:59:10	@mythmon	it's possible to get xbmc to smoothly play netflix, but it requires pipelight, and requires you to script clicking the ui buttons with a controller.
2014-06-04 22:59:10	@hamper	mythmon: moooooooooooooooooooo
2014-06-04 22:59:21	@mythmon	though... actually, I think someone made a better one, mainly by extreme hacks.
2014-06-04 23:00:36	@jnoah	tbf, extreme hacks are what usually get things going to start
2014-06-04 23:02:17	@mythmon	i do hope that EME catches on, in that I hope it replaces Flash/Silverlight streamers.
2014-06-04 23:02:41	@mythmon	which is the reason it's getting pushed.
2014-06-04 23:09:22	@jnoah	ohwow. it's after 11

2014-06-05 13:57:09	@mythmon	hmm
2014-06-05 13:57:09	@edunham	so many pretty people with so little personal space
2014-06-05 13:58:12	@mythmon	edunham: jealous. also, in addition to a solution for http://xkcd.com/173/ ,  I think one could calculate a 'cuddle puddle coefficient', related to how people are attracted.
2014-06-05 13:58:51	@mythmon	(yes, mythmon, apply math to social situations. that makes them better.)
2014-06-05 13:59:20	@chekkaa	I'm not sure that positioning within a puddle would be static
2014-06-05 13:59:36	@bryon	i don't really care about the order in which a group of people sits in a row at the theater, as long as I'm on the aisle
2014-06-05 13:59:43	@lucyw	This one time at band camp...
2014-06-05 13:59:51	@mythmon	bryon: so what you are saying is you care.
2014-06-05 14:00:00	@bryon	...I fucked the entire low brass section.
2014-06-05 14:00:10	@bryon	i mean....
2014-06-05 14:00:22	@mythmon	bryon: huh. i didn't realize you were so flexible.
2014-06-05 14:00:31	@bryon	=D
2014-06-05 14:00:43	@bryon	everybody knows low brass makes the best lovers
2014-06-05 14:01:05	@mythmon	i'm not even sure what low brass is, so...
2014-06-05 14:01:17	@bryon	tuba, baritone, trombone, etc
2014-06-05 14:01:27	@chekkaa	trumpets are surprisingly versatile instruments
2014-06-05 14:01:29	@mythmon	i see.
2014-06-05 14:01:29	@bryon	all the "brass" intsruments in the "low" register
2014-06-05 14:01:30	@lucyw	Well, the clearly know how to use their tongues.
2014-06-05 14:01:37	@bryon	lucyw++
2014-06-05 14:02:09	@mythmon	and i guess at least some of them would have good finger dexterity.
2014-06-05 14:02:10	@bryon	lucyw: also, keep a good steady rhythm
2014-06-05 14:02:25	@edunham	mythmon++ for xkcd
2014-06-05 14:02:32	@edunham	bryon: gee thanks :)
2014-06-05 14:02:45	@edunham	chekkaa: uhh cuddle puddles are kinda dynamic. did you miss out on hs theater?
2014-06-05 14:03:02	@chekkaa	edunham: I said they would not be static
2014-06-05 14:03:05	@edunham	oh
2014-06-05 14:03:07	@edunham	then i misread; sorry
2014-06-05 14:03:20	@bryon	oh you crazy kids and your agreements
2014-06-05 14:03:24	@chekkaa	also hs theater @_@
2014-06-05 14:03:30	@mythmon	edunham: one of these days i want to make a solver for that.
2014-06-05 14:03:32	@mythmon	(the xkcd)
2014-06-05 14:03:57	@edunham	hmm maybe in monte
2014-06-05 14:04:15	@edunham	lucyw: you know what they say... never dance with a trombonist, a french hornist, or a bongo player :)
2014-06-05 14:04:24	@edunham	or at least, that's what we used to say
2014-06-05 14:04:49	@jnoah	over my head :/
2014-06-05 14:04:57	@mythmon	I don't know any band stuff.
2014-06-05 14:04:59	@mythmon	way over my head.
2014-06-05 14:05:14	@jnoah	edunham: story time?
2014-06-05 14:05:17	@mythmon	edunham: also, why not "bongoist" ?
2014-06-05 14:05:20	@edunham	haha yeah, it's a joke better told in person, after a drink, with a nice lady to assist.
2014-06-05 14:06:38	@bryon	i haven't heard that before...  why not?
2014-06-05 14:07:24	@bryon	what's the punchline?
2014-06-05 14:08:13	@lucyw	google does not know this one :(
2014-06-05 14:08:13	@mythmon	i'm going to guess it's crude and requires gestures.
2014-06-05 14:08:25	@mythmon	sadly, those don't work on irc.
2014-06-05 14:08:55	@bryon	i'm hoping edunham will explain it
2014-06-05 14:09:34	@chekkaa	we need a crude-gesture-to-ascii plugin

2014-06-05 14:09:49	@lucyw	they'd have to be animated though
2014-06-05 14:10:41	@chekkaa	shrink your buffer size to the line number and have it just keep sending updated versions?
2014-06-05 14:10:45	@edunham	heh
2014-06-05 14:11:37	@mythmon	(animated irc)++
2014-06-05 14:11:46	@edunham	actually meatspac.es...
2014-06-05 14:11:48	@edunham	but no.
2014-06-05 14:11:53	@bryon	so edunham
2014-06-05 14:12:00	 *	mythmon knows the person who made meatspac.es...
2014-06-05 14:12:08	@bryon	your joke? the punchline is...?
2014-06-05 14:12:41	@mythmon	huh. people on meatspaces seem to be making t heir boobs talk...
2014-06-05 14:13:05	@jnoah	sounds like i should not go there while at work...
2014-06-05 14:13:07	@edunham	ok well it won't work as well in text, but
2014-06-05 14:13:27	@edunham	A trombonist goes like...
2014-06-05 14:13:40	@mythmon	it's fairly safe for work. clothes all, just camera placement.
2014-06-05 14:14:01	 *	edunham makes trombone gesture, which would look like reaching down someone's dress if done in excessive proximity
2014-06-05 14:14:34	 *	edunham makes french horn gesture, which... well... http://boostew.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/derek_french_horn_1973.jpg
2014-06-05 14:14:40	@edunham	and I think you know about bongo players.
2014-06-05 14:15:13	@mythmon	ah
2014-06-05 14:15:27	@bryon	ok, i get it now
2014-06-05 14:15:28	@bryon	thanks
2014-06-05 14:15:29	@edunham	:)
2014-06-05 14:15:35	@mythmon	sounds like an entertaining joke to tell.
2014-06-05 14:15:37	@edunham	yup
2014-06-05 14:15:44	@edunham	it's better if people already know it though
2014-06-05 14:15:50	@bryon	you know that kid takes the french horn seriously because he has a leather guard
2014-06-05 14:15:50	@edunham	they just kinda think for a minute then go @_@
2014-06-05 14:16:46	@bryon	also, big ups to french horn players
2014-06-05 14:16:54	@bryon	that mouthpiece is some difficult shit
2014-06-05 14:17:05	@edunham	ya no kidding
2014-06-05 14:17:12	@mythmon	hamper: should i learn how to play some instrument, so i get more of these jokes?
2014-06-05 14:17:12	@hamper	mythmon: Ask again later.
2014-06-05 14:17:13	 *	edunham was a lazy bastard, played baritone then tuba
2014-06-05 14:17:26	 *	bryon <--- tromboner
2014-06-05 14:18:02	 *	jnoah <--- clarinetist
2014-06-05 14:18:03	@bryon	i'm glad that i didn't play such as saxamaphone
2014-06-05 14:18:17	@bryon	because i can still play trombone (in theory)
2014-06-05 14:18:47	@bryon	no way i could get the fingerings for any woodwind instrument
2014-06-05 14:19:46	@jnoah	i actually kinda want to learn flute
2014-06-05 14:19:59	@edunham	I own a clarinet... for reasons...
2014-06-05 14:20:03	@jnoah	but really badly want to learn cello (like, really badly)
2014-06-05 14:20:10	@edunham	ooh yeah, cellos sound super pretty
2014-06-05 14:20:26	@edunham	bryon: I have a baritone in my closet, same mouthpiece and fingering as a valve trombome
2014-06-05 14:20:29	@edunham	*trombone even
2014-06-05 14:20:33	@bryon	yeah
2014-06-05 14:20:43	@edunham	yeah winds just have too damn many keys
2014-06-05 14:20:48	@bryon	i dabbled in baritone & tuba, but trombone was my main jam
2014-06-05 14:21:03	@jnoah	sax, clarinet, guitar for me
2014-06-05 14:21:04	@edunham	ooooh... did you ever get to play an all-silver sousa?
2014-06-05 14:21:12	@bryon	and after a trombone mouthpiece, trumpet feels way too constrictive
2014-06-05 14:21:19	@lucyw	edunham: dildos usually work better...
2014-06-05 14:21:19	@bryon	so i never put much effort into it
2014-06-05 14:21:27	@jnoah	oh, and piano, but i didn't go far with it
2014-06-05 14:21:28	@lucyw	Man, my timing sucks.  Also, sorry if that was in bad taste
2014-06-05 14:21:30	@bryon	lucyw++
2014-06-05 14:21:52	@bryon	trying to remember if i ever played a silver sousa...  i MIGHT HAVE
2014-06-05 14:22:05	@edunham	bryon: it'd probably be memorable
2014-06-05 14:22:07	@mythmon	edunham: "own a clarinet" "for reasons" makes me think of a movie quote you probably didn't intend.
2014-06-05 14:22:08	@edunham	they sound SO PRETTY
2014-06-05 14:22:16	@lucyw	jnoah: If you'd like, I'd be down to do some informal piano lessons :)
2014-06-05 14:22:25	@lucyw	I have some easy sheet music even
2014-06-05 14:22:28	@bryon	lucyw: a dildo works better
2014-06-05 14:22:31	@bryon	=d
2014-06-05 14:22:33	@bryon	=D
2014-06-05 14:22:36	@edunham	mythmon: well considering that the reasons involved attempting to do something which I later discovered was physically very difficult, for the motivation of impressing a guy...
2014-06-05 14:22:38	@mythmon	oh, which lucyw already referenced.
2014-06-05 14:22:47	@jnoah	lucyw: you play?
2014-06-05 14:22:51	@mythmon	edunham: ah.
2014-06-05 14:22:52	@lucyw	yeah :)
2014-06-05 14:22:57	@edunham	they're not necessarily so dissimilar, though I do not stick woodwinds into bodily orifices other than my mouth.
2014-06-05 14:22:58	@jnoah	awesome
2014-06-05 14:23:20	@edunham	lucyw: :D why don't you play in KEC more often?
2014-06-05 14:23:29	@edunham	<3 musics
2014-06-05 14:23:32	@mythmon	i think the woodwinds would be hard to clean afterwards anyways.
2014-06-05 14:23:48	@chekkaa	I know spaceshi1s plays several times a week in KEC
2014-06-05 14:24:16	@chekkaa	I usually see him there at around 2pm MWF
2014-06-05 14:24:17	@lucyw	edunham: the things we do for love...or at least good sex.  And there's piano in the basement of West, which is less nervewracking to practice on :)
2014-06-05 14:24:29	@chekkaa	spaceshi1s: keep up the good work btw :)
2014-06-05 14:24:31	@jnoah	spaceshi1s: plays very well too (better than a lot of people i've heard in kelly)
2014-06-05 14:25:09	@lucyw	I can teach anyone else too--if you're interested
2014-06-05 14:25:17	@mythmon	edunham: i guess the real question is, was he impressed?
2014-06-05 14:25:36	@edunham	mythmon: haha no my actual implication was that I attempted to learn to make music on different instruments
2014-06-05 14:25:46	@edunham	since I have not yet succeeded, i have not disclosed the existance of the attempt
2014-06-05 14:25:52	@mythmon	edunham: i see.
2014-06-05 14:26:01	@jnoah	edunham: do you play much these days?
2014-06-05 14:26:01	@edunham	sorry for the boring ending :P
2014-06-05 14:26:06	@edunham	jnoah: play *what*?
2014-06-05 14:26:08	@edunham	answer, no.
2014-06-05 14:26:15	@jnoah	musical instruments
2014-06-05 14:26:18	@mythmon	edunham: minecraft.
2014-06-05 14:26:21	@edunham	haven't touched brass in like 4 years, and it's the only thing I got very far at...
2014-06-05 14:27:34	@bryon	i still have my horn in storage
2014-06-05 14:27:47	@bryon	i haven't touched it since like 1999
2014-06-05 14:27:56	@bryon	but i can't bring myself to get rid of it
2014-06-05 14:28:19	@mythmon	speaking of instruments, any of you know things about Rocksmith?
2014-06-05 14:28:30	 *	jnoah doesn't
2014-06-05 14:28:43	@bryon	i know of it
2014-06-05 14:28:48	@bryon	but have never played it
2014-06-05 14:29:01	@mythmon	i know little about guitars, and i played a few songs on Rocksmith when I last visited my sister, and it seemed to be an interesting way to hurt my fingers.
2014-06-05 14:29:03	@bryon	again, my fingers are butt, so i never bothered
2014-06-05 14:29:20	@chekkaa	mythmon: what do you want to know?
2014-06-05 14:29:29	@edunham	bryon: doesn't really matter for trombones
2014-06-05 14:29:35	@bryon	yeah
2014-06-05 14:29:38	@edunham	I'll bet some sugru hacks could make the slide grippable
2014-06-05 14:29:38	@mythmon	chekkaa: i'm mainly curious to hear people who have played it and know guitar.
2014-06-05 14:29:44	@mythmon	and what they think of it as a way to learn.
2014-06-05 14:29:58	@chekkaa	mythmon: I have some friends who do both; I can ask them
2014-06-05 14:29:59	@bryon	edunham: i was referring to rocksmith. =]
2014-06-05 14:30:13	@edunham	oh derp
2014-06-05 14:30:20	@edunham	sorry wasn't reading entire backscroll
2014-06-05 14:30:25	@bryon	no worries
2014-06-05 14:30:41	@bryon	i'm just glad i don't have a valve trombone
2014-06-05 14:31:06	@bryon	well..  i do, but it's on the 1 valve, and it's a rotary valve, controled by the thumb
2014-06-05 14:31:12	@bryon	on = only
2014-06-05 14:31:31	@bryon	for hitting those LOW notes
2014-06-05 14:32:29	@edunham	the ones that sound like an amorous moose :3

2014-06-05 14:40:33	@chekkaa	I think they open at 7?
2014-06-05 14:40:38	@bryon	"It's like a baritone."

2014-06-05 14:45:18	@edunham	see also never learning to improvise, transpose, or do any other real-musician things....
2014-06-05 14:45:35	@bryon	improvising is easy
2014-06-05 14:45:41	@bryon	staying in key while doing so, not so much
2014-06-05 14:45:44	@Alan_S	edunham: no jazz tuba for you?
2014-06-05 14:46:12	@bryon	people who can transpose on the fly get much respect from me

2014-06-06 22:57:05	@pop_n_fresh	Homosapien didn't get published until ~1955...
2014-06-06 22:58:20	@pop_n_fresh	I'm completely clueless... No homo was just... said...
2014-06-06 22:58:29	@pop_n_fresh	It seems for no reasons...
2014-06-06 22:59:20	@pop_n_fresh	Although homo and no homo did spike around the same time... Still begs the question what homo meant back then...
2014-06-06 23:01:28	@pop_n_fresh	http://goo.gl/kw4XRA This service is endlessly fascinating...
2014-06-06 23:02:29	@jnoah	wut
2014-06-06 23:02:37	@jnoah	1805
2014-06-06 23:02:56	@jnoah	old gens gettin' down with the out loud laughs
2014-06-06 23:05:11	@pop_n_fresh	Also 'twitter' spiked in the mid 1800s...
2014-06-06 23:05:17	@jnoah	pop_n_fresh: https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=homo%2C+no+homo&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Chomo%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cno%20homo%3B%2Cc0
2014-06-06 23:05:17	@hamper	jnoah: mooooooooooooo
2014-06-06 23:05:28	@pop_n_fresh	And 'reddit' is at an all time low.
2014-06-06 23:06:13	@jnoah	but, it was more popular than twitter in the early 1800s
2014-06-06 23:06:44	@pop_n_fresh	I guess twitter spiked in the early 1900's.
2014-06-06 23:07:30	@pop_n_fresh	There's also no data since 2008 so a lot of this will be more interesting once it starts scraping fom web pages and we've got a ~10 year lead on the information.
2014-06-06 23:08:19	@pop_n_fresh	Apperently the word internet was used in the 1800's... I'm believing this stuff less and less...
2014-06-06 23:08:21	@jnoah	yeah
2014-06-06 23:09:24	@pop_n_fresh	http://goo.gl/DxzEUI comment on humanity?
2014-06-06 23:10:22	@jnoah	we be negative :/
2014-06-06 23:10:27	@mythmon	no
2014-06-06 23:10:39	@mythmon	it's actually probably because "no" is a part of grammar.
2014-06-06 23:10:43	@mythmon	"he had no reason to be here"
2014-06-06 23:11:03	@mythmon	whereas yes is only used as a response, and even then, not often in written text.
2014-06-06 23:11:24	@bryon	does it count incidences of 'no' within other words?
2014-06-06 23:11:28	@bryon	nothing
2014-06-06 23:11:33	@bryon	knob
2014-06-06 23:11:36	@jnoah	i've been wondering that
2014-06-06 23:11:38	@jnoah	i'm not sure
2014-06-06 23:11:39	@bryon	etc
2014-06-06 23:12:09	@pop_n_fresh	I hadn't thought of that. It probably counts 'no' within words. So 'You knob you know nothing' would be three.
2014-06-06 23:12:20	@bryon	yeah
2014-06-06 23:12:23	@pop_n_fresh	Wait... maybe...
2014-06-06 23:12:35	@mythmon	i really doubt it.
2014-06-06 23:12:36	@bryon	and "yes" occurs within other words so much more infrequently
2014-06-06 23:12:44	@mythmon	google is better than that.

2014-06-06 23:13:55	@chekkaa	I just searched for "e" and it got almost no hits
2014-06-06 23:14:15	@pop_n_fresh	mythmon: I'm changing my stance. I'm pretty sure it only counts stand alone occurences.
2014-06-06 23:14:19	@bryon	Dude, you need to search in different places
2014-06-06 23:14:25	@mythmon	chekkaa++ for doing science.
2014-06-06 23:14:30	@chekkaa	google was a thing in 1900?
2014-06-06 23:14:32	@bryon	go to the club and search for 'e' and you will get as many hits as you can afford
2014-06-06 23:15:21	@chekkaa	oh, I get it now
2014-06-06 23:15:24	@chekkaa	took me a while
2014-06-06 23:15:29	@bryon	=]
2014-06-06 23:15:38	@jnoah	as in burrito hits?
2014-06-06 23:15:53	@pop_n_fresh	jnoah: Duh. What other kind?
2014-06-06 23:16:16	@chekkaa	if you wanna put that in your burritos, sure
2014-06-06 23:17:26	@pop_n_fresh	If it's in a burrito it tastes amazing. Don't listen to what anybody else tells you.

2014-06-06 23:23:04	@bryon	that is a douchebag move
2014-06-06 23:23:11	@bryon	that shit is not good for the mic
2014-06-06 23:28:45	@bryon	am i the only one who finds Kaley Cuoco to be not that attractive?
2014-06-06 23:33:36	@bryon	(Penny from Big Bang Theory)
2014-06-06 23:35:39	@jnoah	i find her meh
2014-06-06 23:35:46	@bryon	yeah, same
2014-06-06 23:35:53	@jnoah	attractive, sure, but not really into her
2014-06-06 23:36:02	@bryon	i don't imagine she will age well
2014-06-06 23:36:15	@jnoah	heh, prolly not
2014-06-06 23:36:43	@pop_n_fresh	Is that show popular around here?
2014-06-06 23:37:28	@jnoah	dunno, prolly not?
2014-06-06 23:37:35	@bryon	i've heard people talking about it
2014-06-06 23:37:51	@bryon	i've seen some episodes, and it's amusing if you can suspend your disbelief
2014-06-06 23:38:34	@pop_n_fresh	I'm not a huge fan. My dad and I watched it for the first few seasons and then it totally abandoned it's fanbase to get more viewers. Lost my appreciation.
2014-06-06 23:57:22	@Odysimus	I have a like/hate take on the show. It helps bring science into popular culture, while at the same time casting a very unflattering light on science.
2014-06-07 00:01:32	@chekkaa	I haven't watched it much. Does it really contain any scientific value at all?
2014-06-07 00:03:41	@bryon	well, they actually got someone w/ a doctorate in neuroscience to play a neuroscientist
2014-06-07 00:03:48	@bryon	so that's cool
2014-06-07 00:03:59	@chekkaa	and she's an actor too? o_O
2014-06-07 00:04:13	@bryon	fun fact: that same person also played Blossom on the hit tv show, Blossom

2014-06-11 15:39:46	@lrr	gg bryon, i mean AlternateNick
2014-06-11 15:40:29	@chekkaa	is there a chat system out there that is decentralized, offers text and voice, is encrypted, and allows for both channel-based and conversation-based (like skype) groups?
2014-06-11 15:40:38	@chekkaa	like a cross between irc and skype
2014-06-11 15:40:44	--	AlternateNick is now known as bryon
2014-06-11 15:40:56	@chekkaa	oh, and persistence
2014-06-11 15:41:11	@bryon	ventrilo?
2014-06-11 15:41:13	@chekkaa	i.e. you receive messages next time you're online
2014-06-11 15:41:25	@bryon	i haven't used ventrilo in like 10 years
2014-06-11 15:41:38	@bryon	so I dunno what all it does these days
2014-06-11 15:41:48	@chekkaa	never used it either
2014-06-11 15:41:56	@chekkaa	but I assume it's like mumble and teamspeak
2014-06-11 15:42:00	@bryon	chekkaa: just write your own
2014-06-11 15:42:31	@bryon	i don't think mumble was a thing back then (or else i just didn't know about it) but i feel like it was a better alternative to teamspeak back in the day
2014-06-11 15:42:39	@bryon	teamspeak had a better UI, but less functionality
2014-06-11 15:42:45	@chekkaa	which afaik are server-based, require being online to get messages, and don't allow multi-pms
2014-06-11 15:43:07	@chekkaa	multi-pms are one of my favorite features of skype
2014-06-11 15:43:26	@bryon	s/it was/ventrilo was/
2014-06-11 15:43:26	@hamper	bryon actually meant: i don't think mumble was a thing back then (or else i just didn't know about it) but i feel like ventrilo was a better alternative to teamspeak back in the day
2014-06-11 15:43:35	@chekkaa	you don't have to copy-paste messages between everyone or tell everyone to go join an empty channel
2014-06-11 15:44:40	@Alan_S	if you want to receive massages next time you are online you pretty much have to have a server
2014-06-11 15:44:59	@chekkaa	Alan_S: that can definitely be distributed
2014-06-11 15:45:10	@chekkaa	see all cryptocurrencies
2014-06-11 15:45:23	@chekkaa	you can get money while offline
2014-06-11 15:45:35	@chekkaa	and you "receive" it when you resync to the network
2014-06-11 15:45:49	@jnoah	chekkaa: why you no LocalBoyz?
2014-06-11 15:45:55	@chekkaa	jnoah: sleep happened

2014-06-11 15:47:16	@chekkaa	a cryptocurrency-like chat network + voice when people are online?
2014-06-11 15:47:20	@Alan_S	this actually sounds like an interesting project
2014-06-11 15:47:27	@spectralsun	this is already being made
2014-06-11 15:47:36	@chekkaa	spectralsun: do tell
2014-06-11 15:48:11	@spectralsun	you're describing core features of the G3RM technology stack
2014-06-11 15:48:19	@spectralsun	which is in spec/development
2014-06-11 15:48:31	@bryon	IT'S A PYRAMID SCHEME@!
2014-06-11 15:48:36	@bryon	REJECT THE G3RM!
2014-06-11 15:48:47	@bryon	lol
2014-06-11 15:49:00	@spectralsun	bryon: um, no
2014-06-11 15:49:07	@bryon	heh heh
2014-06-11 15:49:49	@bryon	yeah... i was at your place and you were trying to tell me about it, and your approach just made it feel like you were trying to sell me on joining some ponzi scheme
2014-06-11 15:50:10	@bryon	"When do you have like 10-20 minutes to talk to this guy about this?"
2014-06-11 15:50:25	@chekkaa	spectralsun: link?
2014-06-11 15:50:35	@bryon	me: "Oh man, what kind of sleazy shit am I going to get roped into?" (in my head)
2014-06-11 15:50:56	@spectralsun	bryon: sounds like you invented a story
2014-06-11 15:50:58	@spectralsun	and then lived in it
2014-06-11 15:51:03	@spectralsun	instead of investigating an unknown
2014-06-11 15:51:09	@spectralsun	but that's ok, you're only human.
2014-06-11 15:51:14	@bryon	yeah
2014-06-11 15:51:28	@spectralsun	chekkaa: you got time for 10-20 minute phone call?
2014-06-11 15:51:36	@Alan_S	hmm, the internet knows not of G3RM
2014-06-11 15:51:44	@spectralsun	it is incubating
2014-06-11 15:51:46	@bryon	lol
2014-06-11 15:51:59	@bryon	chekkaa: don't sign anything. ;)
2014-06-11 15:52:11	@bryon	lol, nah I know it's not a pyramid scheme
2014-06-11 15:52:15	@spectralsun	nobody has ever asked anyone for a signature...
2014-06-11 15:52:22	@bryon	but in that moment that's the vibe i got
2014-06-11 15:52:29	@bryon	spectralsun: i'm just making jokes
2014-06-11 15:52:50	@chekkaa	I do not know what is going on
2014-06-11 15:53:29	@chekkaa	spectralsun: is this something you are working on or in charge of?
2014-06-11 15:53:44	@chekkaa	and is secret for some reason?
2014-06-11 15:54:56	@chekkaa	have I stumbled into foil hat territory?
2014-06-11 15:55:23	@bryon	chekkaa: sit through the 10-20 minute phone call, then judge for yourself
2014-06-11 15:55:58	@bryon	for the record: I never actually got the 10-20 min pitch. I'm just making jokes. Don't listen to me.
2014-06-11 15:56:58	@chekkaa	spectralsun: would you care to elaborate on what g3rm is?
2014-06-11 15:57:12	@bryon	yes, he would
2014-06-11 15:57:22	@bryon	that's why he asked if you have 10-20 min for a phone call
2014-06-11 15:57:28	@bryon	jeez man, catch up
2014-06-11 15:57:51	@chekkaa	oh, with him?
2014-06-11 15:58:01	@bryon	i'm assuming
2014-06-11 15:58:13	@chekkaa	I thought he meant with a g3rm recruiter or something
2014-06-11 15:58:18	@bryon	he might have
2014-06-11 15:58:41	@bryon	where "recruiter" = "someone who can explain better than him, but not actually do any 'recruiting' per se"
2014-06-11 16:07:52	@chekkaa	whatever, we'll have to talk later tonight
2014-06-11 16:08:01	@chekkaa	I need to focus on my final tonight
2014-06-11 16:08:10	@chekkaa	6-8

2014-06-11 16:09:50	@spectralsun	bryon: there is no "pich"
2014-06-11 16:10:01	@spectralsun	we have conversations and people are inspired to create with us or not
2014-06-11 16:10:15	@spectralsun	chekkaa: yes this is something i am involved with

2014-06-11 16:10:23	@hamper	spectralsun actually meant: bryon: there is no "pitch"
2014-06-11 16:10:46	@spectralsun	i dont know where you got the story of "pitch", but it was never said by me... could you please stop inventing stories?
2014-06-11 16:10:55	@Alan_S	is it going to be opensource?
2014-06-11 16:11:01	@spectralsun	Alan_S: of course, 100%
2014-06-11 16:11:22	@spectralsun	onevo is the nonprofit, it used to be one site/game called on3vo
2014-06-11 16:11:28	@bryon	sorry

2014-06-12 21:33:09	@edunham	i was gonna link that in summer-work backchannel about how that'll be me on monday but perhaps with less briefcase and tophat and more jeans and tshirt xD
2014-06-12 21:33:19	@edunham	then i realized it's kinda awkard to liken oneeslf to a penguin :3
2014-06-12 21:33:43	@bryon	summer-work backchannel?
2014-06-12 21:33:45	@jnoah	we'll you're socially awkward...so it's a good match? :P

2014-06-12 21:50:37	@jnoah	bryon: full throttles are good for powering through things
2014-06-12 21:50:52	@jnoah	(more so than coffee for me...coffee's been making my tired recently)
2014-06-12 21:51:22	@bryon	yeah, but at least with coffee you can put cream & sugar in it
2014-06-12 21:51:34	@bryon	full throttle tastes like ass and there's naught to be done for it
2014-06-12 21:52:35	@bryon	coffee is also cheaper
2014-06-12 21:52:44	@jnoah	you get used to the taste and tbf, it's better than the taste of black OSL coffee :)

2014-06-19 21:23:07	@mythmon	i wonder if you could do something similar with the t440
2014-06-19 21:23:14	@edunham	hmm
2014-06-19 21:23:21	@edunham	with like a w-something-something?
2014-06-19 21:23:24	@mythmon	also, you probably shouldn't use my x1c if you feel that way about the t440 :3
2014-06-19 21:23:33	@edunham	actually there's some early... X series maybe?... that didn't have the touchpad at all ,only the nub
2014-06-19 21:23:35	@mythmon	i was thinking a t430 or t420
2014-06-19 21:23:35	@hamper	yolo blaze it

2014-06-19 21:25:06	@edunham	'cause I was never picky until I had like a T60 for a summer
2014-06-19 21:25:10	@edunham	and then i could never go back
2014-06-19 21:25:20	@mythmon	edunham: i had a t420 for about two years.

2014-06-20 21:56:15	@bryon	lol
2014-06-20 21:56:21	@bryon	you mean Cowboy Curtis?
2014-06-20 21:56:32	@jnoah	haha yeah
2014-06-20 21:56:57	@jnoah	anyhow, have you read the GoT books?
2014-06-20 21:57:02	@bryon	yup
2014-06-20 21:57:17	@jnoah	 where does s4 leave off in the books? and would it be possible to pick it up from there?
2014-06-20 21:57:32	@bryon	I don't really know
2014-06-20 21:57:45	@bryon	i read all the books back to back, so they all kind of blend
2014-06-20 21:57:52	@jnoah	ah
2014-06-20 21:58:08	@jnoah	I want to find out, but I don't want to get anything spoiled while searching :/
2014-06-20 21:58:24	@bryon	but bran's trip to the greenseer was severly edited for the show
2014-06-20 21:58:26	@bryon	a lot happened
2014-06-20 21:58:29	@bryon	well
2014-06-20 21:58:33	@bryon	maybe not a LOT
2014-06-20 21:58:43	@bryon	but more than the show depicted
2014-06-20 21:58:50	@jnoah	ah
2014-06-20 21:58:58	@jnoah	well, that's where i should start
2014-06-20 21:58:59	@bryon	jnoah: just start the books at the beginning
2014-06-20 21:59:17	@bryon	there's only like 5 of them
2014-06-20 22:00:53	@jnoah	and more to come if GRRM doesn't die first
2014-06-20 22:01:03	@bryon	yeah
2014-06-20 22:01:26	@bryon	when you read the books, you can really see that he is into food
2014-06-20 22:01:34	@bryon	he describes meals all the time
2014-06-20 22:01:52	@bryon	listing all the succulent gourmet shit these lords are feasting upon
2014-06-20 22:02:40	@jnoah	i started the books a while ago...but only got about 200 pages into the first
2014-06-20 22:02:54	@jnoah	this was before i knew the series was going to be a show
2014-06-20 22:02:58	@jnoah	so a long while ago
2014-06-20 22:03:05	@jnoah	i guess i could pick it up again
2014-06-20 22:03:14	@jnoah	it just seemed really slow
2014-06-20 22:03:30	@bryon	not half as bad as lotr tho

2014-06-23 13:18:27	@bryon	dang, i guess my homedir has been nuked already
2014-06-23 13:19:23	@bryon	oh well
2014-06-23 13:22:39	@bryon	someone was really on top of deprovisioning me
2014-06-23 13:22:40	@bryon	lol
2014-06-23 13:26:15	@pono	bryon: There is a backup of it, if you want it
2014-06-23 13:26:25	@bryon	oooh sweet
2014-06-23 13:26:34	@bryon	i'd like my .bashrc if possible
2014-06-23 13:27:48	@pono	How about the whole tar.gz?
2014-06-23 13:28:01	@bryon	is that my entire homedir?
2014-06-23 13:28:04	@bryon	i don't need that
2014-06-23 13:28:14	@pono	Yeah, minus .cache and .vagrant.d
2014-06-23 13:28:25	@lrr	bryon: it's been tar'd
2014-06-23 13:28:41	@bryon	how big is that tarball?

2014-06-23 13:29:33	@pono	Copying it now
2014-06-23 13:29:41	@bryon	but all i need is the .bashrc

2014-06-23 13:35:18	@Alan_S	adding keys from freenode web connctions with a different nick, seems legit
2014-06-23 13:35:41	@bryon	well, i knew which channel to join, didn't I? =]
2014-06-23 13:37:42	@Alan_S	so did Guest27682, have any keys you need added?
2014-06-23 13:38:00	 *	Alan_S is giving you shit, but thats still kinda sketch
2014-06-23 13:38:27	@bryon	yeah
2014-06-23 13:38:41	deanj	Alan_S: That was exatly what I was thinking haha.
2014-06-23 13:38:53	@bryon	it's why i didn't ask in #osuosl
2014-06-23 13:39:13	deanj	bryon: Couldn't you identify with nickserv though?
2014-06-23 13:39:39	@lrr	damn, i didn't even think about that
2014-06-23 13:39:43	 *	lrr is ashamed
2014-06-23 13:39:49	@bryon	yeah, i suppose i could have ghosted my nick, then taken it back
2014-06-23 13:40:30	deanj	Lessons learned.. at least it wasn't malicious, hopefully. I mean, we don't even know bryon is bryon still :)

2014-06-23 13:42:04	@Alan_S	and now this punk imposter has bryon home dir too
2014-06-23 13:43:34	@edunham	we need to do social verification
2014-06-23 13:43:40	@edunham	ask a bunch of questions to determine who he really is
2014-06-23 13:43:42	@Alan_S	also did you just tar up a home dir with priv keys in it and put it on ash?
2014-06-23 13:43:49	@Alan_S	lrr pono ^^
2014-06-23 13:43:58	@Alan_S	cuz thats not good
2014-06-23 13:44:14	@bryon	all i wanted was my .bashrc
2014-06-23 13:44:39	@lrr	i didn't touch the tar
2014-06-23 13:45:05	@pono	Alan_S: Why?  He had access to his homedir previously, and ash has some of his keys anyways.
2014-06-23 13:45:38	@lrr	Alan_S: i dont think pono added it to public html if that's what you're thinking
2014-06-23 13:45:40	@Alan_S	ohh you out it in his homedir not public_html, ok thats fine
2014-06-23 13:45:47	@pono	lol
2014-06-23 13:49:38	 *	bryon moves the tarball to public_html, blames it on lrr.
2014-06-23 13:50:45	@lrr	:P
2014-06-23 13:53:42	@bryon	ok groovy. i'm glad the tarball was moved because i realized i wanted my .vimrc too

2014-06-23 14:42:49	@edunham	jnoah: nope
2014-06-23 14:43:25	@edunham	i'm going to powell's, then going to war with fedex AGAIN to try to make them hand over my bike, then ordering components for another project (and possibly a phone), then trying to maybe finish musicbox
2014-06-23 14:46:37	@jnoah	Oo wow. Good luck with Fedex
2014-06-23 14:51:16	@lrr	edunham: why is fedex holding your bike at ransom?
2014-06-23 14:51:33	@lrr	also remember fedex doesn't deliver on mondays (unless you specifically pay for monday delivery)
2014-06-23 14:51:37	@lrr	which is BULL SHIT
2014-06-23 14:51:56	@edunham	lrr: nah it's in strange bureaucratic limbo because i made the mistake of trying to intercept it while moving
2014-06-23 14:53:13	@lrr	ah
2014-06-23 14:57:44	@edunham	turns out they really don't like to actually ship you your damn package after you've told it to be held somewhere
2014-06-23 14:57:53	@edunham	nor do they like actually holding it within like 2 days of when you place the hold :T
2014-06-23 14:59:41	@Alan_S	where did you order it from?
2014-06-23 15:00:08	@edunham	uhh silly hipsterbikes place

2014-06-23 15:14:47	@bryon	edunham: DID YOU BUY A FIXIE?!
2014-06-23 15:14:57	@bryon	shame
2014-06-23 15:15:28	@bryon	in other news, my ability to cause simple git commands to fail remains fully functional
2014-06-23 15:15:49	@edunham	:C
2014-06-23 15:16:01	@edunham	ya well my ability to teach git to people remains fully functional, fixie or no\
2014-06-23 15:16:16	@edunham	and it has a flipflop hub so i can turn it into a single speed if i want coasting, thank you very much
2014-06-23 15:16:48	@lrr	edunham: everyone knows that riding a fixie directly affects your ability to tech git
2014-06-23 15:16:51	@lrr	:P
2014-06-23 15:16:55	@bryon	heh
2014-06-23 15:16:56	@lrr	teach*
2014-06-23 15:17:08	@bryon	my experience today at squishy:
2014-06-23 15:17:17	@bryon	git checkout [branch-name]
2014-06-23 15:17:35	@bryon	then "git branch" shows me on master
2014-06-23 15:17:42	@edunham	oh you want checkout -b
2014-06-23 15:17:45	@edunham	if it's a new branch
2014-06-23 15:17:54	@bryon	not a new branch
2014-06-23 15:18:01	@edunham	errrrr
2014-06-23 15:18:05	@edunham	git pull origin branch-name?
2014-06-23 15:18:06	@bryon	yeeeeaaaaah
2014-06-23 15:18:17	@bryon	we've tried numerous ways
2014-06-23 15:18:24	@bryon	gchaix is bewildered
2014-06-23 15:18:36	@bryon	i think we tried that one too
2014-06-23 15:19:18	@bryon	yeah, we just pulled the branch, but we're still on master
2014-06-23 15:19:34	@edunham	close all terminals, reopen, fresh checkout, try again?
2014-06-23 15:19:50	@bryon	lol, we did that
2014-06-23 15:20:16	@bryon	there is much head scratching here
2014-06-23 15:20:36	@edunham	wow, yeah
2014-06-23 15:20:42	@edunham	start digging around in the plumbing?
2014-06-23 15:20:48	@edunham	i almost wonder if you're in the wrong directory
2014-06-23 15:20:53	@bryon	we're not
2014-06-23 15:21:04	@edunham	like these tend to be caused by things so stupid obvious you didn't check
2014-06-23 15:21:12	@bryon	greg is going to try and reproduce on a separate machine
2014-06-23 15:21:46	@edunham	good
2014-06-23 15:22:02	@bryon	in other news, i grabbed an apple from the free food area
2014-06-23 15:22:14	@bryon	mealiest damn apple i've ever had the displeasure of biting into
2014-06-23 15:23:24	@edunham	aww :(
2014-06-23 15:27:16	@jnoah	git pull --rebase origin branch-name ?
2014-06-23 15:28:17	@jnoah	oh
2014-06-23 15:28:39	@jnoah	bryon: git fetch; git rebase; git checkout branch-name
2014-06-23 15:30:33	@edunham	bryon: other than that, how's squishy?
2014-06-23 15:30:40	@jnoah	bryon: if that doesn't work, do: git branch -a
2014-06-23 15:31:04	@jnoah	see if the branch is in the red list (or origin/ list if you don't have colors on)
2014-06-23 15:31:18	@jnoah	if it's not there, then the branch was never pushed to origin
2014-06-23 15:32:04	@bryon	this worked: git checkout -b remote_branch origin/remote_branch
2014-06-23 15:32:19	@jnoah	-b creates a branch
2014-06-23 15:32:20	@bryon	greg came up with that
2014-06-23 15:32:48	@jnoah	check your log, you may have just branched off master
2014-06-23 15:32:49	@bryon	apart from git troubles, squishy seems pretty cool
2014-06-23 15:32:55	@edunham	neat
2014-06-23 15:32:57	@edunham	oh, first day?

2014-06-23 15:56:53	@chekkaa	wait, why more channels?
2014-06-23 15:57:20	@chekkaa	portland peoples can be in this one too
2014-06-23 15:57:33	@Alan_S	for the intersection of osu/osl and wanting to hang out in portland

2014-06-23 17:18:20	@spectralsun	The basic premise of The Interview is that Franco and Rogen attempt to assassinate North Korea???s dear leader, Kim Jong Un. (Although, wouldn???t Americans feel offended if say, Iraq made a movie about assassinating our president?)

2014-06-23 18:53:57	deanj	So... chrome takes 4 gb of ram with all the tabs I have open. Firefox only takes like 500 mb. :D
2014-06-23 18:55:10	@jnoah	how many tabs each?
2014-06-23 18:57:16	deanj	~20
2014-06-23 18:57:39	deanj	Hmm, still uses 1gb for firefox I guess, but still.. not 4 lol.
2014-06-23 18:58:20	deanj	I'm pretty sure it's because firefox doesn't do much more than put the contents of each page in RAM plus a bit of metadata. Chrome on the otherhand starts a new process per window.
2014-06-23 22:03:38	@jnoah	edunham: any luck with fedex and fetting your bike?
2014-06-23 22:32:04	@chekkaa	deanj: firefox also doesn't load all the tabs you haven't visited yet if you reopen a session with lots of tabs
2014-06-23 22:32:19	@chekkaa	very nice if you keep lots of youtube tabs open
2014-06-23 22:32:56	@jnoah	chekkaa: true, but moz has done a fantastic job at minimizing memory usage as of late

2014-06-26 14:44:51	@bryon	meh
2014-06-26 14:45:09	@bryon	Emergen-C used to have a cranberry flavor mix
2014-06-26 14:45:23	@bryon	now it's cran-pomegranate
2014-06-26 14:45:38	@bryon	and it's vastly inferior in flavor to the straight cran
2014-06-26 14:45:50	@bryon	and they don't sell the cran anymore, as far as i can tell
2014-06-26 14:46:54	 *	lrr doesn't do emergen-c
2014-06-26 14:47:02	@bryon	lrr should
2014-06-26 14:47:10	@lrr	why?
2014-06-26 14:47:10	@bryon	it's pretty lrr-git
2014-06-26 14:47:13	@bryon	=D
2014-06-26 14:47:29	@lrr	it's just a shit load of vitamin c (which your body will piss out w/o using anyway)
2014-06-26 14:47:42	@bryon	it's more than just C
2014-06-26 14:47:49	@lrr	and b vitamins
2014-06-26 14:48:06	@bryon	it's a pretty robust multivitamin, depending on the kind you get
2014-06-26 14:48:30	@bryon	and it's pre-dissolved in water, so i figure your body can m ore readily absorb it
2014-06-26 14:48:43	@bryon	instead of dissolving a pill in your stomach
2014-06-26 14:48:57	@bryon	that might be bullshit, but w/e
2014-06-26 14:49:04	@edunham	aargh why are python bots so much easier to hack than ruby ones
2014-06-26 14:49:07	@bryon	the placebo effect is real
2014-06-26 14:49:17	@bryon	because python > ruby?
2014-06-26 14:49:24	@bryon	or maybe because python < ruby?
2014-06-26 14:50:22	deanj	python is more english than ruby, and therefore easier to understand the magic.
2014-06-26 14:50:52	@edunham	or maybe 'cause i've been using the one for over 3 years and the other for under 3 weeeks
2014-06-26 14:51:30	@bryon	that's probably why
2014-06-26 14:51:40	deanj	nah, that can't be it
2014-06-26 14:51:50	@bryon	oh yeah, that's what I meant
2014-06-26 14:53:03	@lrr	ruby is teh crazy
2014-06-26 15:36:12	@jnoah	I just met Alex Gaynor, he's cool people
2014-06-26 15:39:11	@edunham	yup
2014-06-26 15:39:19	@edunham	he's leet python haxor
2014-06-26 15:39:25	@edunham	like incredibly so
2014-06-26 15:42:22	@edunham	word of the day: "brodozer" for those giant lifted pickup trucks that never touch mud
2014-06-26 15:42:49	@lrr	lol
2014-06-26 15:44:25	@bryon	oh, i thought those were "douchemobiles"
2014-06-26 15:44:39	@lrr	^^
2014-06-26 15:45:11	@edunham	that too
2014-06-26 15:45:14	@bryon	or, alternatively, "douchewagons"
2014-06-26 16:00:35	@bryon	edunham: here at squishy, people don't even bother hiding their beer in coffee mugs
2014-06-26 16:00:38	@bryon	=]
2014-06-26 16:03:03	@edunham	haha yeah
2014-06-26 16:03:07	@edunham	you guys also have a beer robot
2014-06-26 16:03:11	@edunham	but only 1 keg
2014-06-26 16:03:24	@bryon	i think we have 4
2014-06-26 16:03:30	@bryon	there's 4 taps, anyways
2014-06-26 16:03:38	@bryon	and i'm pretty sure they're all different
2014-06-26 16:04:02	@edunham	oh
2014-06-26 16:04:30	@bryon	tho 1 of them is actually kombucha, i guess
2014-06-26 16:04:38	@bryon	and another is cider i think?
2014-06-26 16:04:42	@bryon	so, 2 beer kegs
2014-06-26 16:04:49	@bryon	one of which is on nitro
2014-06-26 16:04:53	@bryon	so, that's fun

2014-06-26 16:16:55	@lrr	i plead the 5th
2014-06-26 16:31:55	@edunham	i think our 5th keg may run out soon :C
2014-06-26 16:32:02	@edunham	startupworldproblems
2014-06-26 16:32:53	@jnoah	edunham: it's the government spending problem. You have to consume all or they give you less. If you consume all, all the time, you can ask for more :P
2014-06-26 16:33:12	@lrr	edunham: what, you guys don't have replacement kegs on hand?
2014-06-26 16:33:20	@edunham	nah we usually only keep 3
2014-06-26 16:33:24	@edunham	terrible, i know
2014-06-26 16:33:26	@lrr	pfft
2014-06-26 16:36:57	@bryon	i lied
2014-06-26 16:37:01	@bryon	we have 5 taps
2014-06-26 16:37:11	@bryon	3 beer, 1 cider, 1 kombucha
2014-06-26 16:41:02	@edunham	mmmm
2014-06-26 16:41:06	@edunham	i should see what cider we have
2014-06-26 16:41:18	@bryon	i am drinking the cider cu rrently
2014-06-26 16:41:22	@bryon	it's pretty good
2014-06-26 16:41:26	 *	bryon is a cider fan
2014-06-26 17:45:37	@edunham	hmm i'm bored
2014-06-26 17:45:38	@edunham	chef takes too long
2014-06-26 17:48:37	@edunham	then again i'm sneakily moving a service from one DC to another between world cup games
2014-06-26 17:48:53	@edunham	i guess cheffing stupid things at this sort of hour is rather inevitable under the circumstances

2014-06-27 08:09:58	@edunham	hahaha i'm watching the people who know what they're doing fix a production incident
2014-06-27 08:10:17	@edunham	it was just unironically described as "ghetto, restart, unghetto, restart"
2014-06-27 08:11:17	@edunham	'cause apparently when kafka fills its disk you can't just nuke logs, you have to drop the log retention window then kick it so it kills the old logs itself then put it back to match config management
2014-06-27 09:08:26	@edunham	ogod so last night i screwed up using the terrible UI for the icinga (nagios fork) stuff
2014-06-27 09:08:37	@edunham	and it paged my mentor when he was on a date
2014-06-27 09:09:24	@edunham	and then he comes in this morning thanking me for breaking everything 'cause apparently dates with an IRS agent who does the job of a bad shell script (hand-type data from one file into another all day) are HORRIBLE and generally not recommended
2014-06-27 09:09:42	@edunham	it's pretty funny really 'cause this guy seems to have an endless supply of endlessly boring women whom he meets on the internet
2014-06-27 09:53:37	@bryon	boo to boring women
2014-06-27 10:03:36	@edunham	yeeeeah
2014-06-27 10:03:53	@edunham	apparently the ones who resort to online dating are, uhh, either boring or crazy
2014-06-27 10:06:12	@jnoah	or the most part, yes
2014-06-27 10:06:42	@edunham	or have cool secret identities and have to pretend to be boring :D
2014-06-27 10:06:44	@edunham	but i'm an optimist.
2014-06-27 10:12:47	@bryon	for higher probabilities of crazy, check out craigslist casual encounters
2014-06-27 10:15:46	@jnoah	haha, i bet
2014-06-27 10:17:29	@bryon	also, higher probabilities of the herp
2014-06-27 10:18:27	@jnoah	or anything else for that matter
2014-06-27 10:18:35	@bryon	verily
2014-06-27 10:25:49	@edunham	hmm next year i should give a "welcome to irc" type talk at bridge
2014-06-27 10:26:04	@edunham	they might actually accept somethign like that
2014-06-27 10:52:46	@bryon	i've been using the internets to lookup vim stuff, but i've discovered that vim has fairly good builtin help
2014-06-27 10:53:27	@edunham	ya
2014-06-27 10:53:35	@edunham	there was some really good vim link on the top of hn awhile back
2014-06-27 10:53:57	@bryon	i should probably work that website into my regular rotation
2014-06-27 10:55:38	@edunham	yeah
2014-06-27 10:55:47	@edunham	i meant to make a bot to teach me a new vim thingy every couple days
2014-06-27 10:56:21	@bryon	i meant hn, not whatever vim resource it had
2014-06-27 10:56:29	@bryon	but both is probably a good idea
2014-06-27 10:56:58	@edunham	meh hn's overrated
2014-06-27 11:14:37	@edunham	"wanna hear a funny story?" "is it funny ha-ha or funny womp-womp? ...wait, it doesn't really matter"

2014-06-27 11:19:42	@bryon	La Femme d'Argent by Air just a great tune

2014-06-27 11:20:47	@hamper	bryon actually meant: La Femme d'Argent by Air is such a great tune
2014-06-27 11:22:49	@Odysimus	So I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume that most people are up north for chovda
2014-06-27 11:23:36	@bryon	Odysimus: if you can get to the pdx food carts by noon, i'll meet you there
2014-06-27 11:23:39	@bryon	=]
2014-06-27 11:26:07	@edunham	bryon: but look out the window
2014-06-27 11:26:08	@edunham	eww
2014-06-27 11:30:45	 *	deanj enjoys the view outside :)
2014-06-27 11:31:04	@edunham	it's gray and drizzling
2014-06-27 11:31:24	@edunham	but if i look out the window in front of me i can see across 405(?) to that chown hardware store place
2014-06-27 11:31:45	@edunham	which not only makes me giggle with its name, but has a huge glass window in the front and is fully of all different kinds of lamps and lights and thigns
2014-06-27 11:31:53	@edunham	so it's all sparkley and glowy like candlelight
2014-06-27 11:32:37	@bryon	edunham: sorry, i'm not a windows user.
2014-06-27 11:32:38	@bryon	=D

2014-06-27 11:34:01	@edunham	it's typically rain-themed
2014-06-27 11:34:16	@edunham	i should get a phone with a camera and show y'all a pic of my workspace
2014-06-27 11:34:23	@bryon	i'm trying to figure out how this node app knows to redirect to /somepage when somepage isn't defined in the routes.js
2014-06-27 11:36:10	@bryon	edunham: i am glad i didn't ride my bike today
2014-06-27 11:36:43	@edunham	this was my first day biking to work.....
2014-06-27 11:37:01	@bryon	do you have fenders?
2014-06-27 11:37:48	@edunham	not yet
2014-06-27 11:37:57	@edunham	should prolly get some...
2014-06-27 11:38:10	@bryon	yeah
2014-06-27 11:38:22	@bryon	unless you want to rock the racing stripe down your back
2014-06-27 12:10:39	@bryon	wow, the coffee at squishy is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the osl coffee

2014-06-27 12:12:23	@spectralsun	i *might* be moving to pdx soon, either way i will probably be up there a lot
2014-06-27 12:12:36	@bryon	i dig it
2014-06-27 12:12:39	@bryon	holler if you do
2014-06-27 12:12:46	@bryon	i thought you loved c-township?
2014-06-27 12:12:52	@spectralsun	yeah i do
2014-06-27 12:13:05	@spectralsun	if i moved, i would still visit corvallis
2014-06-27 12:13:23	@bryon	why would you move?
2014-06-27 12:13:26	@spectralsun	#pdxpython is pretty big
2014-06-27 12:14:10	@spectralsun	i have lot of friends and family there
2014-06-27 12:14:35	@bryon	same
2014-06-27 12:14:41	@bryon	well, not a LOT
2014-06-27 12:14:47	@bryon	but more than in corvallis
2014-06-27 12:14:48	@bryon	=]
2014-06-27 12:18:22	@spectralsun	yeah
2014-06-27 12:18:59	@bryon	but squishy is pretty nice so far
2014-06-27 12:19:05	@bryon	free snacks & beer
2014-06-27 12:19:07	@bryon	woo
2014-06-27 12:20:36	@spectralsun	thats whats up, what kind of beer(s)?
2014-06-27 12:21:05	@bryon	i imagine it changes when kegs run out
2014-06-27 12:21:22	@bryon	but right now there's a stout, an IPA, a something else, and a cider
2014-06-27 12:21:33	@spectralsun	wow, good selection
2014-06-27 12:21:37	@bryon	i'm assuming they are all locally brewed
2014-06-27 12:21:40	@spectralsun	probably
2014-06-27 12:21:42	@bryon	the stout is on nitro
2014-06-27 12:21:48	@spectralsun	:>
2014-06-27 12:22:00	@bryon	there is also kombucha, if that's your jam
2014-06-27 12:22:10	@spectralsun	nah

2014-06-27 12:22:51	@spectralsun	ive looked at it some
2014-06-27 12:22:55	@Alan_S	bryon: isn't there a website for this, or is it internal only?
2014-06-27 12:22:56	@spectralsun	never made anything with it
2014-06-27 12:23:15	@bryon	Alan_S: define "this"
2014-06-27 12:23:31	@Alan_S	squishys current taps
2014-06-27 12:23:37	@bryon	oh, maybe
2014-06-27 12:23:44	@bryon	kegbot
2014-06-27 12:24:37	@mythmon	bryon: for your angular stuff, try and grep for '.when('. That file will probably have the angular url routes, including that redirect.
2014-06-27 12:24:48	@bryon	i figured out the redirect
2014-06-27 12:24:54	@mythmon	ah

2014-06-29 09:58:08	edunham	so reality check, is that actually funny, or just dryly ironic commentary on the human condition (oh god, the hipsteritis, noooo)

2014-06-29 10:22:10	@jnoah	it is. it's a jab at hipster because they pay to look homeless.
2014-06-29 10:23:40	@jnoah	or rather, it let's the person hearing the joke come to the hilarious conclusion that hipster pay to look homeless. /me can words better

2014-06-30 10:16:36	@lrr	jnoah: well, i don't have too much against node.js, but having a crypto library ONLY implemented in node.js is bad
2014-06-30 10:16:42	@spectralsun	jnoah: encourages highly nested callbacks, erodes projects/communities with bad methods and poor code
2014-06-30 10:17:49	@jnoah	spectralsun: doesn't javascript itself encourage highly nested callbacks?
2014-06-30 10:17:57	@spectralsun	jnoah: yep, its bad enough in the browser
2014-06-30 10:19:54	@jnoah	so the node.js being bad argument is moot if all the reasons apply to the language it comes from, isn't it? So rather, javascript is bad and node does nothing to help that.

2014-07-01 06:53:09	@jnoah	it's not bad, but i'm a bit of a social person and i don't know anyone here any more
2014-07-01 07:56:15	edunham	http://imgur.com/gallery/1Oq5eC0 neat
2014-07-01 08:12:49	@jnoah	edunham: have a project coming up or just something interesting?
2014-07-01 08:47:07	edunham	?
2014-07-01 08:47:27	edunham	nah i'm just happy that someone else did the tutorial
2014-07-01 08:47:32	@jnoah	ah
2014-07-01 09:08:34	edunham	ugh our hosting provider just fell over RIGHT AS A SPORTSBALL GAME WAS STARTING

2014-07-01 09:08:40	edunham	is

2014-07-01 09:09:30	@jnoah	fuuuuuuuuu
2014-07-01 09:09:39	@jnoah	that's terribad
2014-07-01 09:09:42	edunham	welll i mean it was only an 8min downtime
2014-07-01 09:09:44	edunham	but god
2014-07-01 09:11:04	@jnoah	that must have been an intense 8min in the office
2014-07-01 09:15:28	edunham	ehh three's kind of nothing we can do
2014-07-01 09:16:59	@jnoah	'cept possibly lose money
2014-07-01 09:17:07	@jnoah	:/
2014-07-01 09:21:07	@lucyw	noob question: what does Urban Airship *do*?
2014-07-01 09:21:48	edunham	lucyw: good question! I didn't really know either till a couple weeks ago :)
2014-07-01 09:22:02	edunham	soo y'know when you install an app on a smartphone, you can get push notifications?
2014-07-01 09:22:13	edunham	so notifications that show up even when the app's not necessarily active
2014-07-01 09:22:40	edunham	maybe it's a fitness app to remind you when to leave the house if you're biking to work
2014-07-01 09:23:01	@lucyw	Ok, yeah, I follow
2014-07-01 09:23:06	edunham	maybe it's ads for a tent if you're walking past an REI store and were shopping for tents in the REI app earlier in the week
2014-07-01 09:23:30	edunham	maybe you sign up to be notified every time your favorite team scores a goal
2014-07-01 09:23:58	edunham	the corporations who build the apps that use push notifications seem to, for some damn reason, give us an imperial fucktonne of money for sending the push notifications for them
2014-07-01 09:24:13	edunham	and for making it easy and reliable to send the right notification at the right time, etc.
2014-07-01 09:24:15	@lucyw	That's it?
2014-07-01 09:24:21	edunham	mostly
2014-07-01 09:24:24	edunham	there are a few other things
2014-07-01 09:24:28	@lucyw	Ah, well, that's cool :)
2014-07-01 09:24:30	edunham	we have some digital wallet integration stuff
2014-07-01 09:24:34	edunham	we graph shit all pretty
2014-07-01 09:24:38	edunham	but that's the core of it
2014-07-01 09:24:41	@lucyw	Oooo, I like graphs
2014-07-01 09:24:47	edunham	lucyw++
2014-07-01 09:25:13	edunham	but yeah basically we get money because people who sell things like to advertise
2014-07-01 09:25:19	edunham	this is the same profit model on which Google gets money
2014-07-01 09:25:28	edunham	so I'm pretty convinced that it's reliable
2014-07-01 09:26:24	@jnoah	edunham: are these PNs for iphone only or other mobile OSes as well?
2014-07-01 09:26:41	@lucyw	I would be too--I think most companies take the "Well, people are buying things, so the advertisments must be working!" approach (there are some interesting studies on this, and how even when it's proven that ads don't help a company they will still pay for them.)
2014-07-01 09:27:18	@lucyw	^Not to say that that's every company, but it happens
2014-07-01 09:27:28	@jnoah	ohnoes manatee just shat
2014-07-01 09:27:50	edunham	jnoah: android, iphone, blackberry, amazon phone
2014-07-01 09:27:52	edunham	all the things
2014-07-01 09:27:56	@jnoah	ah
2014-07-01 09:28:00	edunham	lucyw: that's true of smaller companies
2014-07-01 09:28:09	edunham	but the big ones put a *lot* of effort into optimizing their ads
2014-07-01 09:28:17	edunham	especially online they track things like click-through and conversion rate
2014-07-01 09:28:24	@jnoah	yep
2014-07-01 09:28:31	@jnoah	appnexus tracks a lot of that stuff
2014-07-01 09:28:47	edunham	turns out that by tailoring push messages to users the way we do, you can turn the clickthrough rate from like 6% to like 40% in some cases
2014-07-01 09:28:51	edunham	which is pretty phenomenal
2014-07-01 09:28:58	edunham	jnoah: how's that appnexus stuff going, btw?
2014-07-01 09:29:37	@jnoah	from the contact you set me up with, i got an email on friday saying my resume had made it to the right people and I should be hearing from them soon
2014-07-01 09:29:53	@lucyw	Oh, dang.  That's more than I would have guessed
2014-07-01 09:29:53	edunham	nice
2014-07-01 09:30:03	edunham	lucyw: ya ikr
2014-07-01 09:30:16	edunham	turns out that if you only show people stuff that they find interesting, they'll be more interested xD
2014-07-01 09:30:26	edunham	sorry that sounds condescending
2014-07-01 09:30:26	edunham	but like
2014-07-01 09:30:29	@lucyw	Science!
2014-07-01 09:30:50	@jnoah	psychology is a thing, we can use it to make money :)
2014-07-01 09:32:39	edunham	yeah it's pretty cool
2014-07-01 10:15:18	@spectralsun	i know someone who just got hired to be a recruiter for google with only a psych degree
2014-07-01 10:15:38	edunham	psych degree + tech experience would probably make a pretty good recruiter

2014-07-01 10:26:20	edunham	spectralsun: coding skill is, unfortuantely, not sexually transmitted :(
2014-07-01 10:26:31	edunham	so that doesn't really carry any information to me
2014-07-01 10:26:36	@spectralsun	hahaha
2014-07-01 10:26:44	@spectralsun	they have dated for a long time and she has learned a lot from him
2014-07-01 10:26:47	edunham	mm ok
2014-07-01 10:26:51	edunham	does she actually build stuff though?
2014-07-01 10:26:52	@spectralsun	it rubs off
2014-07-01 10:27:06	edunham	able to converse on a topic != able to build thigns
2014-07-01 10:27:07	@spectralsun	no, but shes familiar with some concepts i expect, my gf sure is lol
2014-07-01 10:27:14	edunham	like i can talk haskell all day but not write anything in it
2014-07-01 10:27:18	@spectralsun	i taught my gf to write her own website
2014-07-01 10:27:21	edunham	cool
2014-07-01 10:27:27	@spectralsun	i dont think the ohter girl can do that
2014-07-01 10:27:41	@spectralsun	but she at least has some exposure
2014-07-01 10:27:49	@spectralsun	she got the job, 5 rounds of interviews

2014-07-01 13:53:59	@jnoah	otherwise everyone else is rebasing all the time
2014-07-01 13:54:16	@bryon	better than freebasing all the time
2014-07-01 13:54:23	@jnoah	or merging master on master...which is terrible
2014-07-01 13:54:33	edunham	ok kids you ahve a repo now, fight it out over which branching model you wanna juse
2014-07-01 13:54:39	edunham	just dont' settle it by drinking contest, mmkay?

2014-07-01 13:56:32	edunham	and then maybe use a real methodology when cleaning it up
2014-07-01 13:56:40	@lrr	jnoah: we;ve migrated to a branching model for the cookbooks

2014-07-01 14:22:53	@jnoah	ya, our keeper blocked like 5 in a row
2014-07-01 14:23:11	@bryon	that is maybe why the crowd cheered very exictedly

2014-07-01 14:42:54	@jnoah	Alan_S: build is easy, it takes a bit of time though (only worth it if you plan on using it for more than the markdown previewer though)

2014-07-01 15:27:47	@lucyw	We're going over what a pseudo-random number generator is in data structures atm
2014-07-01 15:27:50	@lucyw	wooooo
2014-07-01 15:29:52	edunham	today i got stickers http://imgur.com/cF58YGz

2014-07-01 15:30:27	@jnoah	lucyw: they can be interesting if you're into that stuff :)
2014-07-01 15:30:47	edunham	one of each
2014-07-01 15:30:50	edunham	same as everyone else
2014-07-01 15:30:55	@jnoah	nice
2014-07-01 15:31:04	 *	edunham adores the oval one
2014-07-01 15:31:19	@jnoah	i like the top right one
2014-07-01 15:31:21	@Mathuin	Ah, thought you could only pick one ("your favorite") and yes, the oval one is pretty cool.
2014-07-01 15:32:10	edunham	yeah the advertising appears to have lied :3
2014-07-01 15:32:15	@lucyw	jnoah: They're very interesting.  We're going over what they *are*.  Someone asked why the computer can't just generate a random number on it's own.
2014-07-01 15:32:25	@jnoah	haha
2014-07-01 15:32:27	edunham	because determinism!
2014-07-01 15:32:35	edunham	and it kind of can if it has a radiation detector or w/e
2014-07-01 15:32:48	edunham	if by random we mean random-enough
2014-07-01 15:33:12	@jnoah	quantum fluctuations ftw
2014-07-01 15:33:21	@Alan_S	:(

2014-07-01 15:35:00	@Mathuin	Are we out, or what?
2014-07-01 15:35:21	@Alan_S	yep
2014-07-01 15:35:26	@Mathuin	Ah well.
2014-07-01 15:35:48	@jnoah	that's the best USA has done in forever
2014-07-01 15:44:34	edunham	other QOTD... "When someone sportses the ball, drink "
2014-07-01 15:45:11	@jnoah	well depending on the definition of "sportses" you could either be dead or 3 shots in for the last game
2014-07-01 15:45:34	edunham	yup
2014-07-01 15:46:57	@jnoah	and if it's at work, i hope it's the latter
2014-07-01 15:48:18	edunham	heh
2014-07-01 15:56:24	@Alan_S	so, its hot outside

2014-07-01 15:57:34	edunham	Alan_S: yeah it's kinda terrifying
2014-07-01 15:58:00	 *	edunham bussed instead of biking to work today because of this exact forecast thing
2014-07-01 15:58:37	 *	lrr biked
2014-07-01 15:58:45	@lrr	mainly because i want to grab beer on the way home
2014-07-01 15:58:48	edunham	lrr: is corvallis as bad as pdx?
2014-07-01 15:59:00	@lrr	my phone says it's 95 in corvallis
2014-07-01 16:00:56	@Mathuin	36C here
2014-07-01 16:01:00	@jnoah	edunham: i posted earlier, it was 93 then
2014-07-01 16:01:04	@jnoah	so yeah, it's bad
2014-07-01 16:01:23	@lrr	it's not bad
2014-07-01 16:01:27	@lrr	it's just warm
2014-07-01 16:01:38	edunham	jnoah: oh, you're in corvallis? i thought you were eugene
2014-07-01 16:01:39	@lrr	it's bad when it's 96+
2014-07-01 16:01:50	@Mathuin	The hovel has no AC.  It'll be hotter than pants.
2014-07-01 16:02:07	@jnoah	edunham: i'm in eugene, i posted the temp for all three cities (for comparison)
2014-07-01 16:02:16	edunham	oh well i wasn't reading then
2014-07-01 16:02:20	edunham	must've been trying to get work done
2014-07-01 16:02:22	edunham	sorry
2014-07-01 16:02:37	@Mathuin	That'd've hurt if you'd said it to anyone but jnoah. ;-)
2014-07-01 16:03:45	@jnoah	edunham: no worries, as you say to me all the time, read your backlogs :P

2014-07-01 16:04:45	@lrr	Mathuin: i highly recomend investing in a portable AC unit
2014-07-01 16:04:58	@lrr	i did last summer and it helped a TON
2014-07-01 16:05:08	@lrr	and i only noticed ~$5/month change in electricity bill
2014-07-01 16:07:25	@Mathuin	We have unconventional windows which make normal AC units a pain to install.
2014-07-01 16:08:00	@lrr	Mathuin: my complex disallows the window units, so i got an internal one that has a vent pipe going to the window
2014-07-01 16:08:49	@lrr	Mathuin: something like these: http://www.homedepot.com/p/LG-Electronics-8-000-BTU-Portable-Air-Conditioner-and-Dehumidifier-Function-with-Remote-Control-48-Pints-Day-LP0814WNR/204684040?cm_mmc=SEM|THD|D29A&mid=0diJpKRF|dc_mtid_8903tb925190_pcrid_37776819942&gclid=COm75Nedpb8CFZNffgodmS8A3g

2014-07-01 16:12:15	@jnoah	pop_n_fresh: there is a weechat plugin like lrr was saying
2014-07-01 16:12:19	@lrr	i think there is a config option in weechat for wrapping link lines
2014-07-01 16:12:38	@pop_n_fresh	jnoah lrr: Sweet! I'll have to find that.
2014-07-01 16:12:49	@lrr	or there's also urlserver for weechat
2014-07-01 16:12:51	@Mathuin	Hmm!  Worth looking into....
2014-07-01 16:13:10	@lrr	Mathuin: i highly recommend it, especially one that has a delay-on timer
2014-07-01 16:29:48	@jnoah	edunham: you get your stuff done now that sportsball is over?
2014-07-01 16:30:07	edunham	right now i'm being angry at alfred for being broken
2014-07-01 16:38:13	@chekkaa	urlserver is great
2014-07-01 16:38:16	@chekkaa	thanks for mentioning it
2014-07-01 16:38:57	@chekkaa	it even has a setting to only make redirects if it would actually make the url shorter

2014-07-02 11:53:15	@Mathuin	Clearly you need a "standing desk" with 80% water support.  Stand in the shallow end with the laptop just barely in reach.  get a nice comfy arm rest so you don't get carpal tunnel.
2014-07-02 11:53:40	@jnoah	^ yes

2014-07-02 12:49:42	@lrr	Mathuin: it already is in effect, but you'll need to run apt-get -t wheezy-backports install 0ad
2014-07-02 12:50:12	@lrr	afaik, without messing around with apt repo pinning, there's not a way to force chef to install things when backports (at least for how we have our recipes written)
2014-07-02 12:50:20	@Mathuin	Is there a reason we dont' backports all the things?
2014-07-02 12:50:29	@lrr	i dunno
2014-07-02 12:51:14	@lrr	i mean, you could do something like "apt-get -t wheezy-backports upgrade" and backports all the things, but i think that might also cause isues

2014-07-02 12:52:48	@lrr	lol
2014-07-02 12:53:47	@Mathuin	It'll upgrade 76 and leave 79 un-upgraded -- and who the hell knows what the nightly update will do to that.
2014-07-02 12:53:52	@Mathuin	I'll leave it be.
2014-07-02 12:54:05	@lrr	lol
2014-07-02 12:54:15	@lrr	i think the 79 un-upgraded is related to kernel stuffs
2014-07-02 12:54:24	@lrr	since backports has 3.12 iirc
2014-07-02 12:54:33	@Mathuin	libreoffice is in there, so is postfix, that's all I saw.
2014-07-02 12:54:34	@lrr	which means new glibc and all the stuff related to that
2014-07-02 12:54:51	@Mathuin	But yeah, now 0ad is Alpha XVI with lots more familiar features.
2014-07-02 12:54:53	@lrr	Mathuin: try dist-upgrade instead of upgrade

2014-07-02 16:01:29	@Mathuin	Ever sine I learned jello shots were used in animal testing, I haven't really seen them the same way since.
2014-07-02 16:01:48	@lucyw	Well, thanks for ruining them for the rest of us.
2014-07-02 16:01:53	@Mathuin	Hee!

2014-07-02 16:03:48	@jnoah	:D
2014-07-02 16:03:48	@Mathuin	That link?  You are mocking that link because it has five different names in the hostname.
2014-07-02 16:04:19	@Mathuin	The second link, well, once you've logged in you should see "Jello Shots and Cocktails as Ethanol Vehicles: Parametric Studies with High- and Low-Saccharin-Consuming Rats".
2014-07-02 16:05:00	@Mathuin	In related papers, they provide details on the brain surgery they perform on the rats.  That was too much for me.
2014-07-02 16:05:44	@Mathuin	That one is titled "Brain ethanol levels in rats after voluntary ethanol consumption using a sweetened gelatin vehicle"

2014-07-02 16:08:25	@Mathuin	I love the picture titled "rolled dough with ..."  They obviously put the onions on, realized they wanted a picture without them, removed them, took the pic, and put them back on.
