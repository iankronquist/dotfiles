2014-04-29 13:34:02	edunham	yeah, i guess for being in a 6% minority, i'm an unusual student too :/
2014-04-29 13:36:14	terrellt	Alright, not a python guy - what do I have to do to make python's erroring actually throw an exit code in OSULUG-Website's build.sh?
2014-04-29 13:37:31	muricula	edunham: how do I invite myself to dev again? I screwed up weechat;s settings
2014-04-29 13:37:35	mythmon	terrellt: if there is a real python exception, it should exit with non-zero already. but that wouldn't make build.sh return non-zero
2014-04-29 13:37:42	edunham	muricula: /msg chanserv invite #channel
2014-04-29 13:37:43	terrellt	Right.
2014-04-29 13:37:53	muricula	Hmm I  tried that
2014-04-29 13:37:56	mythmon	so you need to either put bash into 'error if anything errors' mode, or check the return value with $?
2014-04-29 13:38:22	muricula	oh, lower case chanserv
2014-04-29 13:38:50	jnoah	case doesn't matter for nicks
2014-04-29 13:39:12	muricula	no, wait I could invite myself to dev, but not infra or staff
2014-04-29 13:39:24	 *	Fyrexus puts head down and thinks "why is cs311 soo much... Agh!"
2014-04-29 13:39:24	edunham	can't you just join staff?
2014-04-29 13:39:32	jnoah	/q chanserv invite #<channel>
2014-04-29 13:39:38	edunham	Fyrexus: because Kevin might not be as nice a person as you thought :P
2014-04-29 13:39:45	edunham	oh right, you left
2014-04-29 13:39:55	Fyrexus	edunham: Well I'm taking it from Jesse Chaney, but Kevin made the online version.
2014-04-29 13:39:58	jnoah	Fyrexus: what is 311?
2014-04-29 13:40:04	Fyrexus	So it's like taking the class from his ghost. Operating Systems.
2014-04-29 13:40:06	jnoah	oh
2014-04-29 13:40:20	edunham	Fyrexus: that's 'cause it's the weed-out. it's weeded me out twice so far.
2014-04-29 13:40:36	bryon	algorithms weeded me out twice
2014-04-29 13:40:37	Fyrexus	edunham: ME TOO. I took it Winter AND Spring
2014-04-29 13:40:45	Fyrexus	s/Winter/Fall/
2014-04-29 13:40:45	@hamper	Fyrexus actually meant: edunham: ME TOO. I took it Fall AND Spring
2014-04-29 13:40:49	bryon	I somehow managed an A in 311 on my first try
2014-04-29 13:40:54	Fyrexus	s/Spring/Winter/
2014-04-29 13:40:54	@hamper	Fyrexus actually meant: edunham: ME TOO. I took it Winter AND Winter
2014-04-29 13:41:04	mythmon	311 is operating systems I, right?
2014-04-29 13:41:06	Fyrexus	Wow that was a fail, I took it Fall and Winter.
2014-04-29 13:41:10	Fyrexus	mythmon: yes
2014-04-29 13:41:10	bryon	mythmon: yes
2014-04-29 13:41:11	muricula	mythmon: yes
2014-04-29 13:41:14	bryon	mythmon: yes
2014-04-29 13:41:16	mythmon	for me half the class was "here is how to use linux"
2014-04-29 13:41:17	Fyrexus	^jinx
2014-04-29 13:41:20	Fyrexus	where's my soda
2014-04-29 13:41:23	mythmon	and the other half was some fun C stuff.
2014-04-29 13:41:24	jnoah	mythmon: yes
2014-04-29 13:41:27	 *	jnoah is late
2014-04-29 13:41:27	mythmon	huh
2014-04-29 13:41:30	edunham	Fyrexus: in a vending machine
2014-04-29 13:41:47	jnoah	^ w/o the :
2014-04-29 13:41:50	mythmon	maybe the person i took it from was easier. I forgot her name though.
2014-04-29 13:41:52	jnoah	i was confused
2014-04-29 13:41:57	edunham	mythmon: who'd you have it from?
2014-04-29 13:42:02	mythmon	edunham: I forgot her name :(
2014-04-29 13:42:04	edunham	oops, was scrolled up
2014-04-29 13:42:08	edunham	chris wallace?
2014-04-29 13:42:17	mythmon	...maybe
2014-04-29 13:42:30	edunham	she and linda were the only lady profs for quite awhile
2014-04-29 13:42:40	edunham	well, and burnett and pancake
2014-04-29 13:42:55	mythmon	edunham: Linda is newer-to-osu, right?
2014-04-29 13:43:03	mythmon	I'm pretty sure it was Wallace.
2014-04-29 13:43:43	deanj	Haha, my roommate just asked, "Dean, do I look like a skankopotomus?"
2014-04-29 13:44:00	bkero	Your response?
2014-04-29 13:44:08	edunham	uhh... if you have to ask something like that, you might already know
2014-04-29 13:44:13	deanj	"No, you look great!"
2014-04-29 13:44:44	deanj	I was just educated a few days ago on to never tell a girl she looks 'fine', because to guys it means she looks... fine, and to women it means they don't look... fine.
2014-04-29 13:45:02	mythmon	depends on the person.
2014-04-29 13:45:28	mythmon	for me i've learned the girls I say it to usually interpret it as I didn't put any thought into the question.
2014-04-29 13:45:30	bryon	deanj: is she a skankapotamus?
2014-04-29 13:45:41	deanj	^ Gah, I suppose. And bryon, nope! :)
2014-04-29 13:45:47	edunham	bryon: you really think that'll have a channel-appropriate answer?
2014-04-29 13:45:54	edunham	like where are you even going with that question
2014-04-29 13:46:01	deanj	bryon++
2014-04-29 13:46:32	bryon	i'm just saying it's possible to be one and not look like one
2014-04-29 13:46:35	bryon	and vice versa
2014-04-29 13:46:47	jordane	My wife has a running list of responses which indicate I have long sinced stopped paying attention and am just answering randomly while I think about somethign else.
2014-04-29 13:46:55	edunham	haha nice
2014-04-29 13:47:11	mythmon	jordane: do you try and find answers that are not on the list?
2014-04-29 13:47:14	terrellt	jordane: You need an app for that - random list of unique responses.
2014-04-29 13:47:32	edunham	nah, if the lady isn't offended by the absentmindedness, it's a more accurate communication to just use one from the lits
2014-04-29 13:47:36	edunham	*list
2014-04-29 13:47:36	edunham	gah
2014-04-29 13:47:37	jordane	mythmon: Nope. Apparently when I really stop paying attention, I start repeating back things said to me.
2014-04-29 13:47:39	edunham	*lits
2014-04-29 13:47:50	edunham	haha nice
2014-04-29 13:47:55	jordane	in answer/I'm paying attention form
2014-04-29 13:47:55	mythmon	jordane: lol.
2014-04-29 13:48:18	jordane	Also, I talk in my sleep
2014-04-29 13:48:28	edunham	heh, don't disclose any root passwords
2014-04-29 13:48:30	jordane	That's gotten me in trouble before.
2014-04-29 13:48:43	jordane	(not disclosing root passwords in my sleep, just sleep talking)
2014-04-29 13:49:03	jordane	edunham: Yeah. I will have conversations if people start talking to me while I'm asleep.
2014-04-29 13:49:09	jordane	Apparently I'm usually really mean though.
2014-04-29 13:49:16	edunham	:C
2014-04-29 13:49:23	edunham	do you also lie about whether you're awake?
2014-04-29 13:49:24	terrellt	https://travis-ci.org/terrellt/OSULUG-Website/builds/24049993 Anyone familiar with wok know why it's erroring? (At the bottom)
2014-04-29 13:49:47	jordane	edunham: I'm not sure. I never remember the conversations. Or if I do, I remember an entirely different conversation.
2014-04-29 13:49:56	mythmon	edunham: are you sure that the lug site builds with 'pip install wok' ?
2014-04-29 13:50:05	mythmon	terrellt: lucyw is having the same problem, but we don't know why yet.
2014-04-29 13:50:07	edunham	mythmon: it used to >.>
2014-04-29 13:50:17	edunham	checkout head~3
2014-04-29 13:50:37	lucyw	I tried using v0.9.0, and got the same errors :/
2014-04-29 13:52:14	 *	Fyrexus is in a vending machine
2014-04-29 13:53:05	jnoah	jordane: Oo

2014-04-29 13:54:31	mythmon	jordane: that wouldn't work?
2014-04-29 13:54:32	jnoah	jordane: of=/ would work?
2014-04-29 13:54:51	jordane	heh. typo.
2014-04-29 13:55:06	jordane	my bouncer dropped the /dev/sd$x part
2014-04-29 13:55:09	mythmon	ah
2014-04-29 13:55:28	Alan_S	terrellt: I got the same wok error when I tried to build the site locally
2014-04-29 13:56:07	mythmon	something must have changed.
2014-04-29 13:56:19	terrellt	How's the site running now?
2014-04-29 13:56:26	mythmon	the site doesn't run
2014-04-29 13:56:32	mythmon	the site is generated, and then is static.
2014-04-29 13:56:52	terrellt	Right, better sentence - how did the site get generated this time around? Or was it rolled back to what was previously generated.
2014-04-29 13:57:08	lucyw	terrellt: it was rolled back
2014-04-29 13:57:29	terrellt	mythmon: https://github.com/mythmon/wok/commit/db74b60b4ba9eeb54209958666f3daae2141ea39 Did you break it?
2014-04-29 13:57:57	mythmon	terrellt: v1.0.0b was published before that commit though.
2014-04-29 13:58:22	mythmon	wok should probably just use datetimes for everything.
2014-04-29 13:58:23	 *	Alan_S supports the blaming of mythmon (as always)
2014-04-29 13:58:28	terrellt	No release tag. =(
2014-04-29 13:58:41	jordane	hamper: should we blame mythmon for all issues with wok?
2014-04-29 13:58:41	@hamper	jordane: I think... Yes.
2014-04-29 13:58:53	lucyw	Alan_S++
2014-04-29 13:58:56	mythmon	jordane: this is one of the few times where that actually sounds reasonable.
2014-04-29 13:59:11	 *	mythmon rolls a new version
2014-04-29 14:01:23	 *	Fyrexus is sad that monitorama is $200 also.
2014-04-29 14:02:20	mythmon	lucyw: terrellt: edunham: et.al.: I just pushed wok v1.1.0 (and it's tagged on github)
2014-04-29 14:02:21	mythmon	please test
2014-04-29 14:02:40	muricula	mythmon++ for fixing his shit
2014-04-29 14:02:50	jordane	Fyrexus: hmm, I thought monitorama had a student ticket price too
2014-04-29 14:02:51	mythmon	muricula: no guarantees this fixes anything.
2014-04-29 14:02:59	mythmon	it just puts us all on the same page.
2014-04-29 14:03:01	terrellt	Pushed to Travis, I'll let it tell me.
2014-04-29 14:03:10	lucyw	mythmon++ for being so nice :)
2014-04-29 14:03:48	mythmon	travis++
2014-04-29 14:03:50	pwnguin	ive always found student prices on conferences amusing
2014-04-29 14:04:01	pwnguin	'come skip class for a discount!'
2014-04-29 14:04:05	mythmon	heh. apparently wok's travis tests are broken.
2014-04-29 14:04:27	terrellt	mythmon: Same error.
2014-04-29 14:04:33	mythmon	terrellt: wooh
2014-04-29 14:04:47	terrellt	I'm going to push up just the travis work and assume it's working, since it's catching errors.
2014-04-29 14:05:12	mythmon	so here is my plan: after I finish upgrading elasticutils on kitsune, i'll go and edit wok to always use datetimes for everything.
2014-04-29 14:05:58	 *	Fyrexus just realized that there's an American Dream in Portland.
2014-04-29 14:05:59	Fyrexus	WOOT
2014-04-29 14:06:04	mythmon	also, woah, 119 downloads of wok in the last day, 291 this week, and 1327 this month.
2014-04-29 14:06:14	muricula	muricula++ (to show lucyw)
2014-04-29 14:06:14	@hamper	Nice try, no modifying your own karma
2014-04-29 14:06:42	Fyrexus	jordane: maybe there's a discount code?
2014-04-29 14:06:51	Fyrexus	http://monitorama.com/#registration
2014-04-29 14:07:20	muricula	mythmon: did you push wok to pypi?
2014-04-29 14:07:24	mythmon	muricula: yes
2014-04-29 14:07:29	muricula	cool
2014-04-29 14:07:36	mythmon	and github
2014-04-29 14:08:49	lucyw	mythmon: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/6991/
2014-04-29 14:09:14	jordane	Fyrexus: maybe.
2014-04-29 14:09:16	 *	jordane shrugs
2014-04-29 14:09:19	terrellt	https://github.com/OSULUG/OSULUG-Website/pull/49 There's my contribution, I should go do real work now.
2014-04-29 14:10:29	mythmon	terrellt++
2014-04-29 14:15:17	terrellt	I wish all my projects had < 2 minute CI times.
2014-04-29 14:16:44	mythmon	that would be wonderful.
2014-04-29 14:16:54	mythmon	my main project has something like 20 minute CI time on a good day.
2014-04-29 14:17:08	mythmon	which is still pretty good, but still slower than i would like.
2014-04-29 14:17:17	lucyw	mythmon: er...I got the same error :/
2014-04-29 14:17:23	mythmon	lucyw: yeah
2014-04-29 14:17:25	lucyw	using v1.1.0
2014-04-29 14:17:25	jnoah	mythmon: CI time is the new compile time
2014-04-29 14:17:31	terrellt	Library's new study room system builds in like...10-16 minutes? Our asset management system takes 19 minutes.
2014-04-29 14:17:35	jnoah	go play with lightsabers or something :P
2014-04-29 14:17:38	mythmon	like I said, I didn't do that because I thought it would fix it.
2014-04-29 14:17:38	terrellt	System dependencies are killin' me.
2014-04-29 14:17:47	mythmon	I did this so that when I go fix it later, we will all be on the same page.
2014-04-29 14:17:59	lucyw	mythmon: sweet :)
2014-04-29 14:18:11	mythmon	thanks though :)
2014-04-29 14:18:11	rordway	terrellt: what are you building with/on?
2014-04-29 14:18:32	terrellt	rordway: It's just Travis-CI. Takes time to install apt dependencies, and apt-cache on Travis-CI is for paying customers only.
2014-04-29 14:18:54	mythmon	kitsune has a lot of git submodules, which are sloooow
2014-04-29 14:18:59	terrellt	rordway: We're caching gem dependencies on S3 at least, that saves like 6 minutes.
2014-04-29 14:19:12	mythmon	then we have to compile redis, and do some other compiled stuff.
2014-04-29 14:19:36	rordway	terrellt: how much would it cost to get the caching?
2014-04-29 14:20:24	rordway	and what about using a self-hosted CI?
2014-04-29 14:21:05	terrellt	rordway: $130/month. ;) There's a reason we don't have it. We had a self-hosted CI once (gitlab CI) and the maintenence was just a bother, plus it's good to use community tools when our codebases are on Github.
2014-04-29 14:21:08	mythmon	(self-hosted CI)--
2014-04-29 14:21:18	mythmon	Travis is great.
2014-04-29 14:21:24	terrellt	It is.
2014-04-29 14:21:31	mythmon	it is so nice to have a decent environment that I don't have to maintain.
2014-04-29 14:22:20	rordway	did gitlab CI not work? or just too hard to keep up to date? no reason we can't keep it up to date
2014-04-29 14:22:50	terrellt	It works alright, configuration is just more complicated, and we have to keep it up. Travis has really tight integration with github too, we can't lose that.
2014-04-29 14:23:19	terrellt	For instance, pull requests automatically trigger CI jobs so you can see the build status.
2014-04-29 14:23:22	rordway	but how many of our projects are on github vs. gitlab?
2014-04-29 14:23:38	rordway	I guess I could just look that up :)
2014-04-29 14:23:43	terrellt	Lol, that's the wrong question. "How many of our projects on gitlab have tests"
2014-04-29 14:23:51	rordway	lol
2014-04-29 14:23:59	rordway	hey, that's your job buddy
2014-04-29 14:24:03	mythmon	We ran on an internal Jenkins CI server
2014-04-29 14:24:12	terrellt	Right, which is why all my projects since I've started have tests. ;)
2014-04-29 14:24:18	mythmon	it was flaky. it was annoying. it had intermittent failures. switching to travis made us a lot happier.
2014-04-29 14:24:31	terrellt	mythmon: CWS hosts a jenkins server they swear by, but my gosh that devops time.
2014-04-29 14:25:48	muricula	mythmon: does servo use unsafe rust code
2014-04-29 14:25:50	muricula	?
2014-04-29 14:26:42	mythmon	muricula: i have no idea. probably.
2014-04-29 14:27:00	mythmon	have you tried #servo on irc.mozilla.org?
2014-04-29 14:27:51	bryon	have you tried #tomservo on irc.satelliteoflove.com?
2014-04-29 14:28:06	 *	bryon has got nuthin.
2014-04-29 14:29:06	terrellt	Wonder how cheap we could get private repos on github for.
2014-04-29 14:29:13	bryon	free
2014-04-29 14:29:19	bryon	(if you're a student)
2014-04-29 14:29:21	terrellt	bryon: Not as students.
2014-04-29 14:29:31	terrellt	bryon: As the library.
2014-04-29 14:29:45	bryon	"The Library" = ?
2014-04-29 14:29:49	mythmon	why do you need private repos?
2014-04-29 14:29:53	bryon	public library? valley library?
2014-04-29 14:30:15	rordway	OSU Valley Library
2014-04-29 14:30:35	terrellt	^
2014-04-29 14:31:13	terrellt	mythmon: Our open source policy is new, we haven't pulled apart time to de-sensitize our existing repositories. =)
2014-04-29 14:32:33	mythmon	ah.
2014-04-29 14:32:54	mythmon	also, you know that private-github -> paid travis, yes?
2014-04-29 14:32:59	terrellt	Whaaatt
2014-04-29 14:33:01	terrellt	No I did not.
2014-04-29 14:33:06	terrellt	Oh
2014-04-29 14:33:10	terrellt	You mean if we wanted CI
2014-04-29 14:33:11	terrellt	Yes
2014-04-29 14:33:16	terrellt	That I do know. =)
2014-04-29 14:35:03	mythmon	yeah, i mean that free travis cannot access private github repos.
2014-04-29 14:35:23	terrellt	Right, if it's cheap I just think there's a benefit in system convergence.
2014-04-29 14:37:16	 *	mythmon nods
2014-04-29 14:37:33	mythmon	terrellt: have you seen the github pricing page? are you hoping to get better prices?
2014-04-29 14:37:47	terrellt	mythmon: Educational institutions get discounts, they have to request it.
2014-04-29 14:37:54	mythmon	got it.
2014-04-29 14:38:11	chance	terrellt: is this the library?
2014-04-29 14:38:20	terrellt	chance: The Valley Library, yup.
2014-04-29 14:38:59	chance	when i worked at the helpdesk, about a year and a half ago, i told Rich, my boss id re-write the valley library study room system
2014-04-29 14:39:06	chance	i was willing to too
2014-04-29 14:39:15	terrellt	chance: Was that when it was millenium?
2014-04-29 14:39:17	chance	and then hes like "yeah they're buying a new one"
2014-04-29 14:39:23	chance	bullshit i say
2014-04-29 14:39:51	chance	idk, it just sucked. the people at the desk couldnt tell you when they could expect the next reservation to end
2014-04-29 14:40:05	chance	like "we have no idea when cards come back, just that they're late"
2014-04-29 14:40:16	chance	btw, your readme is scary
2014-04-29 14:40:19	terrellt	chance: We hired a student worker to write one, which we ran with for a year or so. There were some problems with it, we just released the new version. http://github.com/osulp/Room-Reservation // http://rooms.library.oregonstate.edu Criticism and pull requests welcome.
2014-04-29 14:40:42	terrellt	Bah, I need to update the not ready for production piece.
2014-04-29 14:40:45	chance	specifically A database server which supports sub-second timestamps.
2014-04-29 14:40:47	chance	Required to avoid race conditions in which two records are updated at the same time.
2014-04-29 14:41:03	chance	that's a scary thing
2014-04-29 14:41:08	terrellt	chance: "Required" in the sense that the caches don't auto-expire right without accurate modified timestamps.
2014-04-29 14:41:15	chance	database transactions solved that problem years ago
2014-04-29 14:41:33	terrellt	chance: The database doesn't have a race condition. The cache keys do.
2014-04-29 14:41:41	chance	what do you mean?
2014-04-29 14:41:50	chance	are you storing cache keys into your db?
2014-04-29 14:42:11	terrellt	chance: No, I'm caching complicated views in memcached under keys that auto-expire based on the records they contain.
2014-04-29 14:42:17	chance	right
2014-04-29 14:42:19	chance	i get how that works
2014-04-29 14:42:24	chance	i dont see where you have a race condition
2014-04-29 14:42:29	chance	you check if its cached, if not pull from the db
2014-04-29 14:42:31	chance	wheres the race O_o
2014-04-29 14:42:51	chance	adding a new entry? always add to db, and add to cache
2014-04-29 14:42:55	chance	no race there either
2014-04-29 14:43:07	chance	ive just never heard of race conditions in a simple thing like that.
2014-04-29 14:43:08	terrellt	chance: You check if its cached by generating the cache key from a sql query, grabbing the last modified record for a set.
2014-04-29 14:43:26	terrellt	chance: If it exists use it, otherwise go through your logic to build the cache.
2014-04-29 14:43:26	chance	why not just check the cache?
2014-04-29 14:43:41	chance	sounds like your defeating the purpose of the cache
2014-04-29 14:43:44	chance	if your querying the db anyways
2014-04-29 14:43:45	mythmon	you shouldn't need to hit the db to check the cache.
2014-04-29 14:43:57	chance	it should just be: check cache, if it fails, check db
2014-04-29 14:44:05	chance	there should not be check db to determine if we need to check cache
2014-04-29 14:44:06	terrellt	mythmon: -If- I wanted to sweep my caches to clear them on updates, I wouldn't have to hit the DB for a millisecond query.
2014-04-29 14:44:20	chance	you can do that anyways
2014-04-29 14:44:28	chance	clearing a cache is simple
2014-04-29 14:44:31	terrellt	chance: I don't have sweepers. The cache auto-expires and I keep the best caches because memcached is an LRU cache.
2014-04-29 14:44:53	terrellt	chance: Auto expires in the sense that it won't get called if the appropriate record's gone.
2014-04-29 14:45:03	chance	a cache miss is fast
2014-04-29 14:45:11	chance	i dont see what your doing or why still
2014-04-29 14:45:14	chance	mostly why
2014-04-29 14:45:15	terrellt	chance: I agree. So is a single select query for one record.
2014-04-29 14:45:24	chance	right, but why not just put it into the db at that point
2014-04-29 14:45:31	chance	theres no point in querying the db if your using a cache
2014-04-29 14:45:34	terrellt	chance: Because my database calls aren't slow.
2014-04-29 14:45:39	terrellt	chance: My view renders are.
2014-04-29 14:45:46	chance	right, but its still pointless if you could just check the cache
2014-04-29 14:45:58	terrellt	chance: But I can't unless I want to maintain the cache.
2014-04-29 14:46:01	chance	its just an entirely extra thing
2014-04-29 14:46:03	chance	sure you can
2014-04-29 14:46:05	terrellt	chance: This way I don't have to maintain the cache.
2014-04-29 14:46:13	terrellt	chance: It maintains itself.
2014-04-29 14:46:22	chance	yeah, you can still make it maintain itself without querying a db
2014-04-29 14:46:28	terrellt	chance: Somebody could run an insert in my database directly from another system (not that they do) and everything would render fine.
2014-04-29 14:46:51	chance	you can cache entire views, and if it expires, it will just call the view func, which then queries the db
2014-04-29 14:46:54	chance	if you need sub view caching
2014-04-29 14:47:02	terrellt	chance: My views don't expire by time. They don't have to.
2014-04-29 14:47:05	muricula	terrellt: are you coming to lug tonight?
2014-04-29 14:47:12	chance	you just pull from the cache explicitly, if it misses, then you just pull form the d
2014-04-29 14:47:14	chance	db
2014-04-29 14:47:16	chance	its simple
2014-04-29 14:47:23	terrellt	chance: Again, my views don't have an expire timer.
2014-04-29 14:47:25	mythmon	terrellt: the point is, the db is much slower, even for simple queries, than memcached.
2014-04-29 14:47:27	terrellt	muricula: Contemplating it.
2014-04-29 14:47:47	mythmon	and if your views expire based on last-modified of objects, than those objects should clear the cache instead of the view checking.
2014-04-29 14:47:54	chance	yeah...
2014-04-29 14:48:09	chance	i dont mean to say "your doing it wrong"..but...you kind of are defeating the purpose of a cache
2014-04-29 14:48:15	mythmon	don't check if you should invalidate the cache, invalidate the cache because you know something changed.
2014-04-29 14:48:20	terrellt	mythmon: Then you're pushing the responsibility for cache maintenence onto the object.
2014-04-29 14:48:20	chance	^
2014-04-29 14:48:26	mythmon	terrellt: yes.
2014-04-29 14:48:30	chance	thats good practice.
2014-04-29 14:48:33	chance	the views should be lean
2014-04-29 14:48:40	chance	fat models, lean views
2014-04-29 14:48:40	mythmon	or, better yet, the object fires an event that says it got saved.
2014-04-29 14:48:48	chance	you can do post_save events on models
2014-04-29 14:48:49	terrellt	chance: My views are lean.
2014-04-29 14:48:49	mythmon	and the thing that knows about caching knows to listen to that event.
2014-04-29 14:48:55	chance	and then its trivial
2014-04-29 14:49:00	muricula	terrellt: you should come. 6:00 PM kelley 1007
2014-04-29 14:49:37	pwnguin	hmm
2014-04-29 14:49:39	terrellt	mythmon chance: Is this a good time to share that the cache depends on factors outside the system as well?
2014-04-29 14:49:41	pwnguin	osu deployed a new theme today?
2014-04-29 14:49:58	chance	terrellt: such as? most of that can still be worked around in a way that makes sense
2014-04-29 14:49:58	mythmon	terrellt: sounds like a bad caching strategy.
2014-04-29 14:50:10	chance	overall your just using your cache poorly
2014-04-29 14:50:13	chance	and getting a lot less out of it
2014-04-29 14:50:20	terrellt	I disagree, I'm getting plenty out of it.
2014-04-29 14:50:22	mathuin	pwnguin: I noticed something wacky on mobile for oregonstate.edu
2014-04-29 14:50:31	mythmon	terrellt: have you measured it?
2014-04-29 14:50:33	chance	if you have a hundred requests per second coming at you, you should be doing 100 db queries per second if you have a cache
2014-04-29 14:50:36	pwnguin	mathuin: so you're that one guy who uses mobile then?
2014-04-29 14:50:40	mythmon	how much faster is a cache-hit than a cache-miss?
2014-04-29 14:50:40	terrellt	mythmon: Yes. 600 ms without a cache, sub 100 with.
2014-04-29 14:50:42	chance	even if you dont have to worry about that
2014-04-29 14:50:46	mathuin	pwnguin: sad but true!
2014-04-29 14:50:51	mythmon	100ms with cache?
2014-04-29 14:50:56	terrellt	Sub.
2014-04-29 14:51:15	chance	those gains are not what you should be seeing
2014-04-29 14:51:17	terrellt	We're not talking page caches here, I'm not serving this thing out of nginx. I still have to deal with the Rails stack, and occasionally I have to rebuild the cache.
2014-04-29 14:51:20	chance	a 6x improvement is bad
2014-04-29 14:51:22	chance	like
2014-04-29 14:51:23	chance	horrible
2014-04-29 14:51:26	chance	for caching
2014-04-29 14:51:30	chance	i know
2014-04-29 14:52:00	chance	im sure mythmon is aware of that, as am i. he works at mozilla as a web dev, he's just trying to give you good advice
2014-04-29 14:52:03	chance	as am I
2014-04-29 14:52:17	terrellt	I'm not doubting your competency here.
2014-04-29 14:52:25	mythmon	terrellt: what are you doing that it's 600ms on cache miss?
2014-04-29 14:52:40	chance	whether you do or dont take advice, thats up to you. but everything you've said up to this point is saying your doing things funky
2014-04-29 14:52:45	chance	including your times
2014-04-29 14:52:46	pwnguin	so the thing about enterprise is, it's basically a huge Sunken Costs Fallacy
2014-04-29 14:52:52	terrellt	mythmon: Interleaving of event types and complicated renders, mostly.
2014-04-29 14:53:01	mythmon	huh
2014-04-29 14:53:15	mythmon	terrellt: to be fair, you have numbers. that's miles ahead of some places.
2014-04-29 14:53:22	chance	yep
2014-04-29 14:53:36	pwnguin	we've already spent $y on technology, so lets not pay you to rewrite it, lets just add this one extra feature as a separate webapp  at price $y/100
2014-04-29 14:53:36	chance	at least you can tell if your improving
2014-04-29 14:53:53	terrellt	New relic is indeed my friend.
2014-04-29 14:54:32	pwnguin	new relic used to be our friend, then they expired our 'special friends' discount
2014-04-29 14:54:33	chance	we use new relic as well
2014-04-29 14:54:37	chance	used*
2014-04-29 14:54:52	chance	pwnguin: i still get emails daily from them about our account
2014-04-29 14:54:54	chance	its weird
2014-04-29 14:56:16	chance	terrellt: https://github.com/osulp/Room-Reservation/blob/develop/app/models/reservation.rb#L88 right here
2014-04-29 14:56:20	terrellt	In any case, it's not like I didn't consider firing off a service to clear the appropriate caches manually on record saves. It would even be easy - the caching happens in only a few places.
2014-04-29 14:56:21	chance	you could invalidate your cache entry
2014-04-29 14:56:45	 *	mythmon feels good about the performance of kitsune today.
2014-04-29 14:56:46	terrellt	Lol, that's a patch for a gem. I could add my own after_save hook though.
2014-04-29 14:57:00	chance	well an after_save would be for updating the cache.
2014-04-29 14:57:11	chance	but after_delete or w/e it is in rails would be good for invaldiating
2014-04-29 14:57:17	terrellt	You can map multiple after_destroy hooks, so I'd add my own for that.
2014-04-29 14:57:25	terrellt	But again, it wouldn't work. Hours are outside my control.
2014-04-29 14:58:12	pwnguin	it amuses me that you need submillisecond accuracy for room hours ;)
2014-04-29 14:58:21	terrellt	Not to mention I wouldn't gain much. Checking that cache out of the database is a few milliseconds. My performance problems are real, but they're primarily because I'm storing too big of globs of stuff in there.
2014-04-29 14:58:24	chance	thats what brought this dicussion up
2014-04-29 14:58:33	-->	vanrysss (~vanrysss@8-40.ptpg.oregonstate.edu) has joined #osu-lug
2014-04-29 14:59:40	chance	overall, do what you want, but you *can* do things better than you are, the README kinda points that out
2014-04-29 15:00:09	chance	im sure you understand the system better than we, but there's still advice that can be taken regardless :)
2014-04-29 15:01:37	chance	on another note, how do you like dealing with banner?
2014-04-29 15:02:12	terrellt	Me? It's not like we're hitting up the database directly.
2014-04-29 15:02:20	terrellt	So pretty painless.
2014-04-29 15:02:35	terrellt	We get the occasional status problem, but I get to push that up the stack.
2014-04-29 15:02:54	rordway	are we doing anything with banner besides the dumps we get?
2014-04-29 15:03:06	terrellt	We encrypt the IDs and stuff it in a relational DB.
2014-04-29 15:03:35	pwnguin	^ this sounds like one of those 'because FERPA' things
2014-04-29 15:03:43	terrellt	Totally.
2014-04-29 15:04:41	chance	huzzah im writing data back to the serial console!
2014-04-29 15:04:43	chance	so close.
2014-04-29 15:04:56	chance	oops
2014-04-29 15:05:22	jordane	chance: what are you working on?
2014-04-29 15:05:53	chance	making it so packer can send commands over serial console instead of vnc
2014-04-29 15:06:03	jordane	chance: ah, I thought that might be it. Nifty.
2014-04-29 15:06:17	chance	yeah, power architecture doesnt have VNC
2014-04-29 15:06:27	jordane	Yep, I'm aware :)
2014-04-29 15:06:28	chance	so the qemu builder needs an alternative
2014-04-29 15:06:34	chance	its pretty cool thus far
2014-04-29 15:06:38	chance	i havent even touched the packer code yet
2014-04-29 15:07:27	chance	mostly just working on reading/writing from a socket which is the serial console socket
2014-04-29 15:08:44	jordane	right
2014-04-29 15:09:36	chance	surprisingly not so hard
2014-04-29 15:09:47	jordane	Yeah, serial is pretty simple.
2014-04-29 15:09:49	chance	and i found out i dont have to worry about figuring out when to login/ect.
2014-04-29 15:10:07	chance	so its just, connect, type things, done.
2014-04-29 15:10:57	chance	here's the reading part: https://gist.github.com/ecnahc515/354d79f5f833dee00b6d
2014-04-29 15:13:00	jordane	nice
2014-04-29 15:13:54	 *	edunham sets up the travis stuff
2014-04-29 15:14:16	edunham	so turns out that standardizing onto datetime fixed it >.>
2014-04-29 15:15:22	mathuin	yay!
2014-04-29 15:16:50	rordway	pwnguin: it's just sub-second datetimes not sub-millisecond datetimes
2014-04-29 15:17:14	rordway	Oracle MySQL doesn't support them until I think 5.6.4
2014-04-29 15:18:02	pwnguin	sure, my bad
2014-04-29 15:18:24	rordway	we're using MariaDB 5.5 which has their own implementation
2014-04-29 15:18:51	terrellt	On an aside, MariaDB++
2014-04-29 15:19:52	rordway	yes
2014-04-29 15:20:37	rordway	just remember to convert your MyISAM tables to InnoDB before you try to use galera
2014-04-29 15:20:44	rordway	smh
2014-04-29 15:20:54	terrellt	Lol
2014-04-29 15:22:56	 *	edunham pushes buttons to make Travis happier
2014-04-29 15:23:25	bkero	edunham: I thought you were a Jenkins lady

2014-04-29 18:52:05	mythmon	though often we test entire views with mock requests, and involve the db a lot, so they could be better.
2014-04-29 18:52:08	mythmon	and by better i mean faster.

2014-04-29 18:54:29	mythmon	you make things that take data and work with it, and test those.

2014-04-29 18:54:59	mythmon	I'd like it to be faster.
2014-04-29 18:55:09	terrellt	mythmon: Agreed, for unit tests. I see a lot of strength in large integration suites.
2014-04-29 18:55:25	mythmon	sure.
2014-04-29 18:55:40	mythmon	our unit test / integration test ratio is a bit low for my liking though.

2014-04-29 23:24:16	thedjpetersen	yeah it has its own way of firing event so I think that may be the problem
2014-04-29 23:24:31	thedjpetersen	the event type is 'SyntheticKeyboardEvent'
2014-04-29 23:27:55	wasingej	chance: thanks
2014-04-29 23:29:24	chekkaa	firefox looks like chrome now
2014-04-29 23:29:26	chekkaa	o_O
2014-04-29 23:29:42	spectralsun	mythmon: whats happening to firefox
2014-04-29 23:29:55	mythmon	spectralsun: version 29 launched today.
2014-04-29 23:30:08	mythmon	chekkaa: chrome's tabs are so pointy.
2014-04-29 23:31:12	<--	wasingej (~jared@8-39.ptpg.oregonstate.edu) has left #osu-lug

2014-04-29 23:32:28	pwnguin	esp good: there will always be darkness
2014-04-29 23:35:11	chekkaa	so is it just me or is adding bookmarks about 3x more painful than in chrome
2014-04-29 23:35:21	chekkaa	and it's pretty bad in chrome
2014-04-29 23:35:36	chekkaa	adding to specific folders at least
2014-04-29 23:35:49	pwnguin	Most people don't even know what sysadmins do, but trust me, if they all took a lunch break at the same time they wouldn't make it to the deli before you ran out of bullets protecting your canned goods from roving bands of mutants.
2014-04-29 23:35:55	pwnguin	""
2014-04-29 23:36:09	mythmon	chekkaa: click star twice, click folder?
2014-04-29 23:36:56	mythmon	i actually don't use folders, so maybe there is something horrible i don't know about.
2014-04-29 23:37:29	chekkaa	click star twice, click expand button, click folder
2014-04-29 23:37:32	_Alice_	chekkaa: vimperatro should make it easy
2014-04-29 23:37:34	chekkaa	however, I take it back
2014-04-29 23:37:49	chekkaa	because you can drag tabs into the bookmark bar and folders
2014-04-29 23:37:50	chekkaa	O_O
2014-04-29 23:38:24	chekkaa	I have wanted that forever!
2014-04-29 23:38:42	mythmon	that hasn't been a thing since forever?
2014-04-29 23:38:57	Fyrexus	jnoah: I just upgraded yes! I think the interface is quite refreshing :)
2014-04-29 23:39:04	mythmon	i've been using australis for a few months. maybe i just forgot what the old interface was like.
2014-04-29 23:39:17	Fyrexus	mythmon: the larger buttons made me think it was more for touch screens, but it's nice
2014-04-29 23:39:26	mythmon	ah.
2014-04-29 23:39:27	chekkaa	maybe it was in firefox for a while and I didn't notice
2014-04-29 23:39:32	chekkaa	it's not in chrome though
2014-04-29 23:39:33	 *	Fyrexus was at the Firefox 29 party with bkero =3
2014-04-29 23:39:37	mythmon	we were working on a touch version.
2014-04-29 23:39:39	mythmon	Fyrexus: nice.
2014-04-29 23:40:00	mythmon	we decided to not do the touch version, because we couldn't dedicate enough to support it.
2014-04-29 23:40:08	Fyrexus	Also, I am looking for summer internships/full time positions for next year... if anyone knows of any openings ;)
2014-04-29 23:40:51	mythmon	Fyrexus: most places won't hire interns unless you are going back to school after the internship.
2014-04-29 23:41:00	mythmon	mainly because it's illegal, from what I'm told.
2014-04-29 23:41:10	chekkaa	what?!
2014-04-29 23:41:25	chekkaa	that seems odd
2014-04-29 23:41:34	mythmon	I am told that Mozilla cannot hire someone as an intern unless we think they are in school.
2014-04-29 23:41:53	chekkaa	internships can be useful to others though...
2014-04-29 23:42:07	mythmon	it's because internships are a special kind of labor, and hiring people who aren't in it for school could be used to abuse the system.
2014-04-29 23:42:19	mythmon	like, hiring people and not giving them benefits type of abuse.
2014-04-29 23:43:41	chekkaa	ah
2014-04-29 23:49:07	mythmon	"The only reason coders' computers work better than non-coders' computers is coders know computers are schizophrenic little children with auto-immune diseases and we don't beat them when they're bad."
2014-04-29 23:55:02	Fyrexus	mythmon: I still have a classes this summer and fall term
2014-04-29 23:55:21	Fyrexus	and possibly winter/spring since one of the classes i need is only offered winter and spring >_>
2014-04-29 23:55:48	mythmon	Fyrexus: my point is, as it has been explained to me, once you graduate you shouldn't be able to get an internship, unless you are planning on more school.
2014-04-29 23:56:12	Fyrexus	ah
2014-04-29 23:56:18	Fyrexus	Full-time plz!
2014-04-29 23:56:20	Fyrexus	;)
2014-04-29 23:56:34	Fyrexus	I have three classes after this term
2014-04-29 23:56:42	Fyrexus	I guess full-time is a better option for me anyways
2014-04-29 23:57:03	Fyrexus	but I'm just worried they'll be like, "you can't work until we see your transcripts with ur degree completed" blah
2014-04-29 23:57:17	mythmon	i wouldn't want to work at a place like that.
2014-04-29 23:57:24	mythmon	but they do exist.
2014-04-30 00:00:12	Fyrexus	ah
2014-04-30 00:10:59	pwnguin	mythmon: i dont think it's a problem, but there's no real point in calling it an internship if you're just hiring someone out of college
2014-04-30 00:11:22	pwnguin	the internship designation really only matters if you're not paying people
2014-04-30 00:14:22	mythmon	fair enough
2014-04-30 00:14:40	mythmon	i tried to find something to cite, but all i found was rules about whether or not you can get by without paying your interns.

2014-04-30 11:14:26	chekkaa	ooh
2014-04-30 11:14:52	chekkaa	I think mars is still supposed to be pretty close, right?
2014-04-30 11:19:38	Odysimus	I think it will be up, not sure how "close" it is
2014-04-30 11:21:12	spectralsun	Odysimus: should be a clear night.
2014-04-30 11:23:41	chekkaa	I think we passed between mars and a sun 2 weeks ago
2014-04-30 11:23:41	Odysimus	we hope, some forecasts are calling for increasing clouds overnight, starting around 9pm.
2014-04-30 11:23:46	chekkaa	the sun*

2014-04-30 13:07:25	jordane	jnoah: Yeah I've seen a lot of chatter about that.
2014-04-30 13:07:26	_Alice_	The difference between a confident guy and a pickup artist is that the latter thinks you're an NPC.
2014-04-30 13:07:32	_Alice_	oh wait they're both men..
2014-04-30 13:07:35	_Alice_	so they both do
2014-04-30 13:07:41	_Alice_	but i giggled..
2014-04-30 13:13:23	jordane	_Alice_: well that is kind of sexist :\
2014-04-30 13:13:48	 *	_Alice_ looks around for edunham 
2014-04-30 13:15:48	drkitty	If you're talking about the majority of men and you're basing it on personal experience or something, whatever. It's an issue if you say that all men are like that or that no women are (assuming we're talking about straight people).
2014-04-30 13:15:52	drkitty	or something
2014-04-30 13:16:04	edunham	huh, pings? hi there _Alice_, what's up?
2014-04-30 13:16:38	_Alice_	nice lack of sense of humor.. i don't even know why i am around
2014-04-30 13:16:46	_Alice_	drkitty: ^
2014-04-30 13:16:53	drkitty	eh
2014-04-30 13:17:09	bryon	edunham: we were talking about sexism and _Alice_  was referencing the ongoing joke that you're a self-proclaimed misogynist
2014-04-30 13:17:16	drkitty	I'm just vaguely irritated by that type of statement. You are of course free to say what you want.
2014-04-30 13:17:18	_Alice_	however if you see me elsewhere on the internet you will probably know i am a misandrist
2014-04-30 13:17:19	edunham	yeah, could we not make sweeping generalizations about people based on attributes they didn't choose to have?
2014-04-30 13:17:23	edunham	that'd be pretty cool.
2014-04-30 13:17:23	bryon	edunham: oh, you are behind me
2014-04-30 13:17:24	_Alice_	and feminazi
2014-04-30 13:17:44	 *	bryon realizes, yet contiues typing
2014-04-30 13:17:53	edunham	bryon: have i ever made that type of remark in a serious or professional context?
2014-04-30 13:17:53	bryon	...and spelling poorly
2014-04-30 13:18:09	bryon	no, hence the "ongoing joke"
2014-04-30 13:18:28	drkitty	Perhaps I missed some of the context.
2014-04-30 13:18:46	edunham	so, on an actual professional note... isn't it great how people of all different opinions can be brought together by belief in an operating system?
2014-04-30 13:18:50	drkitty	lol
2014-04-30 13:18:53	drkitty	linux++
2014-04-30 13:18:59	_Alice_	linux sucks
2014-04-30 13:18:59	edunham	(hint, hint, let's take the politics to more appropriate venues).
2014-04-30 13:19:05	_Alice_	one of the better talks
2014-04-30 13:19:12	 *	bryon joins #politics
2014-04-30 13:19:15	edunham	"Linux sucks, use Linux"
2014-04-30 13:19:18	_Alice_	politics have none
2014-04-30 13:19:20	edunham	nibalizer: ^^^ is this one of your talks?

2014-04-30 13:19:52	edunham	whoa, why are you suddenly yelling
2014-04-30 13:19:56	_Alice_	caps
2014-04-30 13:20:02	edunham	oh, LFNW
2014-04-30 13:20:04	edunham	okay :3
2014-04-30 13:20:06	_Alice_	>capslock
2014-04-30 13:20:08	bryon	HOLY CAPSLOCK
2014-04-30 13:20:12	_Alice_	why does this sht exist
2014-04-30 13:20:17	 *	bryon sets cruise control for "cool"
2014-04-30 13:20:19	edunham	i'm like "oh jeez, is it suddenly a huge problem to have not memorized the schedule"
2014-04-30 13:20:29	_Alice_	also caps are pointless from a gramatical issue
2014-04-30 13:20:31	edunham	uhh, it exists because somebody thought it'd be nice to put a key there for us to bind to metas
2014-04-30 13:20:35	drkitty	_Alice_: environment variables
2014-04-30 13:20:39	_Alice_	they serve no purpose grammar cannot handle
2014-04-30 13:20:43	_Alice_	same with punctuation
2014-04-30 13:20:46	edunham	but they're kinda pointy from an aesthetic one... m vs M, for instance :P
2014-04-30 13:20:54	_Alice_	drkitty: i mean in english
2014-04-30 13:21:04	edunham	_Alice_: there are some violent pandas who'd disagree on the punctuation issue
2014-04-30 13:21:06	drkitty	ah
2014-04-30 13:21:14	_Alice_	other than the .
2014-04-30 13:21:19	_Alice_	there is no need
2014-04-30 13:21:20	edunham	"eats, shoots and leaves" vs "eats shoots, and leaves" and all that
2014-04-30 13:21:32	_Alice_	english ist eine beschissen sprache
2014-04-30 13:21:54	edunham	but the languages we speak tend to care a lot about punctuation
2014-04-30 13:22:08	edunham	ever missed a closing quote on a string?
2014-04-30 13:22:12	 *	bryon loves the Oxford comma.
2014-04-30 13:22:21	_Alice_	hehehe
2014-04-30 13:22:25	_Alice_	i don't
2014-04-30 13:22:26	edunham	I hear that perl actually tells you where it thinks your closing quotes should've been, because it was written by a linguist
2014-04-30 13:22:56	bryon	http://i.imgur.com/fycHx.jpg
2014-04-30 13:22:57	_Alice_	i hear perl is a write only language though
2014-04-30 13:23:36	_Alice_	context is important in western languages
2014-04-30 13:23:38	nibalizer	hai wut
2014-04-30 13:23:44	nibalizer	edunham: i havent given that one yet
2014-04-30 13:23:52	edunham	bryon: please tag nsfw content
2014-04-30 13:23:53	nibalizer	i might give 'macs suck, use macs' tho
2014-04-30 13:23:56	nibalizer	NSFW
2014-04-30 13:23:58	_Alice_	so the oxford comma is only useful for those who can't into following
2014-04-30 13:24:17	bryon	oh sorry, i didn't even realize that could be considered nsfw
2014-04-30 13:24:27	_Alice_	hmm
2014-04-30 13:24:33	bryon	but yeah, i can see how it would be
2014-04-30 13:24:35	edunham	uhh, jfk and stalin as strippers is just *mildly* off-color for a professional setting.
2014-04-30 13:24:45	fridgei	lol
2014-04-30 13:24:45	edunham	nibalizer: that'd probably be pretty neat
2014-04-30 13:24:55	fridgei	i like that there is no definition for nsfw here
2014-04-30 13:25:09	_Alice_	fridgei: ^^
2014-04-30 13:25:14	bryon	nsfw-ness aside, it's an excellent illustration of why the oxford comma is awesome
2014-04-30 13:25:18	fridgei	as in here where i currently am
2014-04-30 13:25:21	fridgei	not in the lug
2014-04-30 13:25:21	edunham	fridgei: yeah we just pretend like people understand these things...
2014-04-30 13:25:22	edunham	oh, yeah
2014-04-30 13:25:24	bryon	fridgei: where is that?
2014-04-30 13:25:26	edunham	heh
2014-04-30 13:25:29	edunham	urban airship
2014-04-30 13:25:33	bryon	ah
2014-04-30 13:25:42	edunham	as long as one doesn't claim that the wrong dinosaurs are cooler, all is well :P
2014-04-30 13:25:49	drkitty	bryon: That nonrestrictive clause is kind of confusing.
2014-04-30 13:25:51	fridgei	yeah
2014-04-30 13:25:58	fridgei	thats an interview question
2014-04-30 13:26:01	fridgei	what is the best dinosaur
2014-04-30 13:26:03	fridgei	and why
2014-04-30 13:26:04	bryon	drkitty: care to elaborate?
2014-04-30 13:26:08	bramwelt	fridgei: Do you have nsfw highlight or something? You showed up fast. ;)
2014-04-30 13:26:21	fridgei	coincidence
2014-04-30 13:26:28	_Alice_	i should highlight it
2014-04-30 13:26:29	bryon	"NSFW? I'm interested in that!" -fridgei
2014-04-30 13:26:30	_Alice_	nao
2014-04-30 13:26:30	fridgei	im packing up to go work forma  bar
2014-04-30 13:26:31	drkitty	"jfk and stalin"
2014-04-30 13:26:44	bramwelt	The best dinosaur is a fed dinosaur.
2014-04-30 13:26:44	drkitty	I don't really care.
2014-04-30 13:26:48	_Alice_	oh and hitler
2014-04-30 13:26:49	fridgei	tilt makes me morbidly obese
2014-04-30 13:26:53	drkitty	(re: words)

2014-04-30 13:27:12	_Alice_	bryon: have you seen Rick and Morty
2014-04-30 13:27:16	bryon	fridgei: what is tilt?
2014-04-30 13:27:17	edunham	bramwelt: opinions on who should be fed to the dinosaur will, of course, differ.
2014-04-30 13:27:31	bryon	_Alice_: only 1 ep, but it cracked me up. it's on my list for futurw viewing
2014-04-30 13:27:33	fridgei	its a restaurant in Portland that hates the people that go there
2014-04-30 13:27:41	bryon	o
2014-04-30 13:27:42	bryon	oh
2014-04-30 13:27:43	fridgei	and punishes them by giving them hamburgers that are too large
2014-04-30 13:27:49	bryon	i see
2014-04-30 13:27:50	bramwelt	fridgei: You just described every resturant in Portland...
2014-04-30 13:27:56	_Alice_	bryon: it's p fun
2014-04-30 13:27:56	fridgei	well
2014-04-30 13:27:57	edunham	bramwelt: except the vegan ones
2014-04-30 13:27:57	fridgei	yeah
2014-04-30 13:28:03	fridgei	but their burgers are fucking ridiculous
2014-04-30 13:28:08	bramwelt	edunham: But they're the worst!
2014-04-30 13:28:09	_Alice_	they're just robots morty
2014-04-30 13:28:13	fridgei	it is almost twice as tall as it is wide
2014-04-30 13:28:22	edunham	oO that sounds... challenging to eat
2014-04-30 13:28:23	fridgei	they are ruthless burgers
2014-04-30 13:28:26	edunham	but i'm sure you could defeat it somehow
2014-04-30 13:28:33	fridgei	oo ive defeated it many times
2014-04-30 13:28:35	bramwelt	They're all like "Hey! You know what you need? Nothing delicious!"
2014-04-30 13:28:40	fridgei	the jokes on me because now i have diabetes
2014-04-30 13:28:52	bramwelt	fridgei: you are diabetes
2014-04-30 13:29:01	fridgei	i wish i had diabetes
2014-04-30 13:29:16	bramwelt	why?
2014-04-30 13:29:17	fridgei	:(
2014-04-30 13:29:22	fridgei	so i can leave dirty needles around town
2014-04-30 13:29:27	bramwelt	>_<
2014-04-30 13:29:28	fridgei	im civic minded like that
2014-04-30 13:29:30	edunham	wait, i thought all one gets from excessively large burgers was heart attacks
2014-04-30 13:29:42	fridgei	nah there is pineapple and shit on it too
2014-04-30 13:29:45	fridgei	its a powerful burger
2014-04-30 13:29:49	fridgei	grilled pork
2014-04-30 13:29:52	fridgei	onion rings
2014-04-30 13:29:53	bryon	oh man, finally!
2014-04-30 13:29:57	fridgei	grilled pineapple
2014-04-30 13:29:58	bramwelt	"pinapple and shit" That sounds like a gross combination
2014-04-30 13:30:01	fridgei	and terriyaki sauce
2014-04-30 13:30:03	bryon	a restaurant that caters to the coprophage in all of us!
2014-04-30 13:30:22	fridgei	there are some artisinal poop restaurants in old town
2014-04-30 13:30:25	fridgei	well they are street venders
2014-04-30 13:30:29	bryon	haw
2014-04-30 13:30:33	bryon	fridgei++
2014-04-30 13:30:35	fridgei	well actually they are homeless peopel who just poop on the sidewalk
2014-04-30 13:30:46	 *	bryon saw that one coming.
2014-04-30 13:30:47	edunham	go write open source code to solve this problem?
2014-04-30 13:30:59	fridgei	how do we code away homeless public defecation?
2014-04-30 13:31:01	fridgei	and why would we want to
2014-04-30 13:31:04	_Alice_	^
2014-04-30 13:31:10	jnoah	pooping on the street is not a thing that can be fixed by code, i'm afraid
2014-04-30 13:31:18	bramwelt	Digital toilets?
2014-04-30 13:31:20	drkitty	drones?
2014-04-30 13:31:25	_Alice_	drones could work
2014-04-30 13:31:28	bryon	we make an app so homeless people can find the closest toilet!
2014-04-30 13:31:30	jnoah	/topic "poop"
2014-04-30 13:31:30	edunham	nah actually pdx installed toilets because that was a problem
2014-04-30 13:31:34	bryon	because they all have iPhones, right?
2014-04-30 13:31:39	edunham	something about optimizing the algorithm for where to put them
2014-04-30 13:31:40	drkitty	jnoah++
2014-04-30 13:31:57	jnoah	bryon: stolen, but yes
2014-04-30 13:31:59	fridgei	i like the grass urinals they are building in SF
2014-04-30 13:32:18	_Alice_	you mean the parks??
2014-04-30 13:32:19	terrellt	We were going to join a Rails two-day hackathon at one point and write "The Castanza App", for crowd-sourcing finding the best bathrooms.
2014-04-30 13:32:22	terrellt	It didn't happen though.
2014-04-30 13:32:36	jnoah	_Alice_: yes
2014-04-30 13:32:37	_Alice_	that would be p fun
2014-04-30 13:32:41	jnoah	those are nice and open
2014-04-30 13:32:50	jnoah	and very public
2014-04-30 13:32:52	_Alice_	Ruby and Rails  >
2014-04-30 13:32:53	edunham	i think hn found an app where people rent out their bathrooms to strangers or something
2014-04-30 13:33:08	muricula	I have a friend borcean who's working on an app which will help disabled people find accessable public restrooms. It is a thing.
2014-04-30 13:33:08	edunham	and it was a startup so hn loved it :3
2014-04-30 13:33:15	jnoah	edunham: wat
2014-04-30 13:33:20	edunham	muricula: that's pretty awesome
2014-04-30 13:33:21	jnoah	i thought that was a joke on a tv show
2014-04-30 13:34:18	fridgei	the difference between startsup on hn and jokes is hard to define
2014-04-30 13:34:37	edunham	one probably provided the inspiration for the other
2014-04-30 13:34:41	edunham	not sure which way around it goes, though
2014-04-30 13:37:06	bkero	edunham: it was airbnb's april fool's joke
2014-04-30 13:37:24	bkero	airpnp or some such :P
2014-04-30 13:37:25	edunham	bkero: oh. well they fooled me :3
2014-04-30 13:37:34	edunham	and seeing as it was hn, i didn't even think to question it
2014-04-30 13:39:02	fridgei	the trick is to never read hacker news
2014-04-30 13:39:15	fridgei	somebody will always tell you about anything there that you should have read
2014-04-30 13:39:24	fridgei	and tell you lots of other things you shouldn't read
2014-04-30 13:39:40	edunham	that's definitely one way to do it
2014-04-30 13:39:53	edunham	my preferred technique is to skim the titles and click the ones that look good
2014-04-30 13:40:04	edunham	because it has the titles more highly concentrated than reddit or slashdot
2014-04-30 13:40:08	edunham	but more or less the same stuff
2014-04-30 13:40:21	edunham	my secret to HN is to never, ever read the comments
2014-04-30 13:40:27	fridgei	well that does help
2014-04-30 13:40:28	bkero	There's some hackernews rss feed that I read. Somehow it culls the terrible things that nobody should ever see.
2014-04-30 13:41:07	pwnguin	well thats the best part
2014-04-30 13:41:14	pwnguin	'shitHNSays'
2014-04-30 13:41:40	edunham	i thought that was a twitter
2014-04-30 13:41:47	edunham	and that culls out only the worst of the worst...
2014-04-30 13:41:49	bkero	Yep yep
2014-04-30 13:41:55	pwnguin	"JavaScript and HTML are a lot more bloat than machine language code written to the wire."
2014-04-30 13:42:04	pwnguin	it is a twitter, but a twitter is also an rss feed
2014-04-30 13:42:11	pwnguin	well, used to be
2014-04-30 13:42:18	bkero	I wouldn't soil my rss reader with twitter feeds

2014-04-30 14:06:45	jnoah	you should always validate input
2014-04-30 14:07:43	edunham	deanj: the reason anyone would try to remind themself in -1 minutes is that Hamper lives in the wild and dangerous world of a channel full of people immensely curious about, and unafraid of breaking, technology :3
2014-04-30 14:09:19	jnoah	also piña coladas
2014-04-30 14:10:01	jnoah	are delicious
2014-04-30 14:10:30	edunham	dude, it's only 2pm
2014-04-30 14:10:48	jnoah	yep, that's why it's only you with one at their desk
2014-04-30 14:10:55	jnoah	:P
2014-04-30 14:11:19	jnoah	(i joke)
2014-04-30 14:11:33	deanj	jnoah: Hamper doesn't break, so I still don't see the issue. If it sends a reminder, the user knows they sent an invalid time, so whatever they get is not guaranteed to be the expected output. Also, this is fixed if !remindme is updated.
2014-04-30 14:11:50	jnoah	deanj: how does hamper handle the negative value?
2014-04-30 14:12:01	edunham	deanj: do you have access to Lug's hamper instance?
2014-04-30 14:12:04	jnoah	will it be stored indefinitely?
2014-04-30 14:12:07	deanj	edunham: Not yet.
2014-04-30 14:12:18	edunham	mythmon: could you give deanj access? ^^^
2014-04-30 14:12:21	deanj	jnoah: Maybe?
2014-04-30 14:12:27	jnoah	deanj: that's a bug then
2014-04-30 14:12:41	jnoah	it should ignore those with negative value
2014-04-30 14:12:54	jnoah	I can submit a patch
2014-04-30 14:12:55	deanj	jnoah: But it could already be abused in the same way. !remindme "1000000000" "test" (ran 1 million times) would still screw up hamper.
2014-04-30 14:13:40	jnoah	true, but less issues, i think, would be better
2014-04-30 14:13:41	deanj	Go for it; I'm not gonna spend a ton of time writing validation for every use case with a plugin that's supposed to be being used by friendly people who aren't trying to waste my time.
2014-04-30 14:14:08	jnoah	heh, deanj, hamper is not just for lug
2014-04-30 14:14:09	deanj	jnoah: It's a waste of time for me to go and spend half an hour writing validation for things that people KNOW are incorrect.
2014-04-30 14:14:32	deanj	^ that don't break anything**
2014-04-30 14:14:34	kennric	deanj: I'm afraid that is part of your job description as a developer
2014-04-30 14:15:09	kennric	because people will often accidentally break things, but if they know somethign is wrong, they are garanteed to do it at some point :)

2014-04-30 14:16:00	edunham	now i'm mad at you 'cause the implied timetravel feature is broken
2014-04-30 14:16:18	edunham	just put in a cute, witty remark about not owning a tardis when handed a negative value, and everybody will be happy :)
2014-04-30 14:16:44	jnoah	deanj: storing a bunch of negative values is bad. Though it doesn't cause hamper to die immediately, it can be an issue. that's all i was trying to get at
2014-04-30 14:16:53	deanj	kennric: With web applications where the scale goes to hundreds or millions of users who aren't technical, and can't read "!remindme <minutes> <message", I would write validation to tell people how to properly format things. When I'm dealing with technically competent people in an IRC channel, I'm not gonna spend time writing validation for queries that don't break anything.
2014-04-30 14:17:04	deanj	jnoah: I agree with that, it could be.
2014-04-30 14:18:56	kennric	That's is how php happened, you know :)
2014-04-30 14:19:10	lrr	lol
2014-04-30 14:19:21	edunham	wow... harsh words, kennric
2014-04-30 14:19:30	edunham	not inaccurate, but dang
2014-04-30 14:19:50	bramwelt	deanj: You should strive for excellence in all the software you write. Not just the software that is used by millions of people.
2014-04-30 14:19:59	deanj	Haha, fair enough. I guess my point is I don't want to go write validation for use cases that the bot will do nothing about (for this instance) when people are just trying to intentionally break my bot. I don't need to tell them it's wrong, they know it's wrong.
2014-04-30 14:20:18	deanj	s/bot/plugin/
2014-04-30 14:20:18	@hamper	deanj actually meant: Haha, fair enough. I guess my point is I don't want to go write validation for use cases that the plugin will do nothing about (for this instance) when people are just trying to intentionally break my bot. I don't need to tell them it's wrong, they know it's wrong.
2014-04-30 14:20:32	edunham	haha yeah, so instead you should take their trolling as an opportunity to troll right back
2014-04-30 14:20:46	edunham	think of it as including easter eggs for anyone creative enough to give it known-bad input
2014-04-30 14:20:53	bryon	speaking of...

2014-04-30 14:21:44	deanj	edunham: Yes, I don't pander to the needs of trolls (that aren't breaking anything) is basically what I'm saying. And edunham, I get more enjoyment from writing more software than easter eggs for trolls.
2014-04-30 14:22:04	terrellt	Are we going to talk about how that pull request could be merged by now?
2014-04-30 14:22:28	edunham	jnoah: PR ready yet? :P
2014-04-30 14:22:37	jnoah	just about
2014-04-30 14:22:42	terrellt	edunham++
2014-04-30 14:22:48	jnoah	but, it's to dean's plugin, not to the hamper repo
2014-04-30 14:23:11	edunham	mythmon: should plugins live in separate repos or in the pluins dir of hamper master?
2014-04-30 14:24:10	terrellt	Submodules!
2014-04-30 14:25:35	deanj	Sorry if I sounded upset. I just don't like feeding trolls, or wasting time writing validation for stuff people (in a technically competent environment) already know won't work, or will work incorrectly, and tell them what they already know. It's simply a waste of time. I DO however agree with complete validation of anything that has the possiblity of breaking your system, or is more complex than a simple
2014-04-30 14:25:37	deanj	regex. (server/client-side validaiton, etc).
2014-04-30 14:26:49	jnoah	deanj: PR sent
2014-04-30 14:26:58	deanj	jnoah: It's fixed already -.-
2014-04-30 14:27:46	jnoah	deanj: where?
2014-04-30 14:27:50	deanj	Last commit removed " " requirement, and only captures digits in the regex, so there can't be a negative number (represented as a string) cast to a float, which then is fed to twisted in a callLater function.
2014-04-30 14:28:21	deanj	Test it out in #CAHamper
2014-04-30 14:28:47	jnoah	deanj: that 'works', but doesn't allow for a reminder of 1.5min now
2014-04-30 14:29:14	deanj	Nope. It wasn't intended to work for fractions of a minute in the first place.
2014-04-30 14:29:35	jnoah	then why'd you wrap with float() instead of int() ?
2014-04-30 14:30:08	deanj	jnoah: It's documented in the code. callLater takes a float as an argument for the number of seconds until a callback is called with the passed arguments.
2014-04-30 14:31:00	jnoah	yes, though duration still could have been an int... oh well, nbd. it works now :)
2014-04-30 14:31:42	deanj	jnoah: Err, there's a TypeError if you pass in an integer.
2014-04-30 14:32:24	deanj	The newest commit also makes it say: '<user> has set a reminder for <message> in <duration> minutes.' without the .0
2014-04-30 14:33:45	jnoah	deanj: i like the drop of ""
2014-04-30 14:33:48	jnoah	good change
2014-04-30 14:36:15	deanj	jnoah: Thanks, and I do appreciate the PR, even if it already was fixed :). If you want a bug to work on, feel free to work on filtering/loading old reminders when the bot was restarted.
2014-04-30 14:36:40	jnoah	ok
2014-04-30 14:37:15	jnoah	also, why is the remindme plugin not in the hamperbot org?
2014-04-30 14:37:24	jnoah	we may want to keep all that work together
2014-04-30 14:38:25	deanj	iirc, mythmon wanted hamper plugins to be separate form hamper itself. We could have a reference to all the plugins in a master repo or something though?
2014-04-30 14:39:05	deanj	Also, anyone have any neat tricks/ideas about inserting a new element to an ordered <select> list in the correct spot?

2014-04-30 21:48:33	jnoah	elescopes
2014-04-30 21:48:43	jnoah	jupiter, mars, etc
2014-04-30 21:48:49	jnoah	telescopes*
2014-04-30 21:49:37	lucyw	Ooooo...how much later will they be there?
2014-04-30 21:50:20	jnoah	dunno, there's a decent crowd and it's still warm
2014-04-30 21:50:45	jnoah	i'd say prolly 'til 10:30 at least
2014-04-30 21:52:44	muricula	chance: err sorry, I had some go questions, but I was helping lucyw and borcean with inheritence
2014-04-30 21:53:02	jnoah	lucyw: halfhour ish
2014-04-30 21:53:48	muricula	chance: what is go's equivalent of a class's method
2014-04-30 21:54:10	jnoah	chance: jealous (abgt100)
2014-04-30 21:54:41	pono	jnoah: Just finished go club.  Had to beat up on some elementary school kids.
2014-04-30 21:55:20	chance	muricula: a function
2014-04-30 21:55:23	chance	there are on classes
2014-04-30 21:55:25	chance	no*
2014-04-30 21:55:26	jnoah	pono++
2014-04-30 21:55:37	chance	so you have methods
2014-04-30 21:55:39	chance	and functions
2014-04-30 21:55:51	chance	methods have recievers and require an type
2014-04-30 21:55:52	muricula	sure.
2014-04-30 21:55:56	shirgan	Does anyone know how to run scripts on shell's version of weechat?
2014-04-30 21:56:11	chance	so a normal function is what you would use
2014-04-30 21:56:29	chance	what purpose does a class method serve that you need in your case
2014-04-30 21:56:39	muricula	 so you cant do  foo.bar()?
2014-04-30 21:56:44	mythmon	spectralsun++ # for being the lowest score in karma
2014-04-30 21:56:54	lucyw	jnoah: argh :/  don't think I can make it.
2014-04-30 21:57:17	chance	muricula: you would need to do foo := &Foo{}; foo.Bar()
2014-04-30 21:57:34	chance	no classes, no inheritance
2014-04-30 21:57:51	mythmon	chance: wait, what language is that?
2014-04-30 21:57:54	chance	Go
2014-04-30 21:58:24	jnoah	:(
2014-04-30 21:58:57	chance	muricula: more details http://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_declarations
2014-04-30 21:59:44	muricula	wait, does go do the signals and slots thing?
2014-04-30 22:00:16	chance	huh?
2014-04-30 22:00:20	mythmon	chance: what is := ?
2014-04-30 22:00:30	muricula	mythmon: I think it's initialize
2014-04-30 22:00:34	mythmon	interesting.
2014-04-30 22:00:36	muricula	like rust's let keyword
2014-04-30 22:01:08	chance	its initialize
2014-04-30 22:01:11	muricula	chance: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html
2014-04-30 22:01:13	chance	but not assign
2014-04-30 22:01:17	chance	assign is =
2014-04-30 22:01:52	chance	muricula: not particularly
2014-04-30 22:01:57	chance	just normal methods
2014-04-30 22:02:23	muricula	so how does a method differ from a function?
2014-04-30 22:02:31	chance	it has a reciever
2014-04-30 22:02:35	chance	which is the object its acting on
2014-04-30 22:02:50	chance	it doesnt *have* to act on that object
2014-04-30 22:02:57	chance	but to execute a method you need an object
2014-04-30 22:03:03	chance	where a function just requires its args
2014-04-30 22:03:23	chance	just like a normal method on an object in python/c++
2014-04-30 22:03:35	chance	its an explicit 'this'
2014-04-30 22:03:37	borcean	Hello everyone :)    Would anyone like to look over my resume? I'm looking for some advice on how I can polish and improve it.
2014-04-30 22:03:47	borcean	I have a copy on Google Docs:
2014-04-30 22:03:48	muricula	borcean++ for coming in here
2014-04-30 22:03:50	mythmon	borcean: i'll take a look.
2014-04-30 22:03:53	borcean	https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6kJ6m0F1s5SSENCeUpRbF9UbVk/edit?pli=1
2014-04-30 22:03:53	@hamper	borcean: remember that some people peruse this channel at work. please flag any nsfw content appropriately.
2014-04-30 22:04:22	mythmon	hamper: uh...
2014-04-30 22:04:38	mythmon	borcean: don't mind hamper. someone gave him a overly-zealous trigger...
2014-04-30 22:04:42	mythmon	hamper: forget all about /d/
2014-04-30 22:04:43	@hamper	Done, mythmon
2014-04-30 22:05:29	jnoah	pono: gonna make it?
2014-04-30 22:06:11	chance	muricula: did what i said make sense?
2014-04-30 22:06:14	mythmon	borcean: any companies you have in mind for this?
2014-04-30 22:06:32	borcean	I'm looking to apply for a position at the OSL
2014-04-30 22:06:52	chance	came to the right place xD
2014-04-30 22:07:00	borcean	:D
2014-04-30 22:07:00	muricula	yes, kinda, I'll read some more. Are there any constructor-ish things in go?
2014-04-30 22:07:29	chance	there are object literals, and otherwise functions
2014-04-30 22:07:38	muricula	which are?
2014-04-30 22:07:57	chance	foo = &Foo{1,"foo"}
2014-04-30 22:08:11	chance	where the order is the order of the struct's fields
2014-04-30 22:08:15	chance	you can also do it key value
2014-04-30 22:08:27	mythmon	borcean: isn't it "Computer Systems Option"? Or did they rename it?
2014-04-30 22:08:46	chance	foo = &Foo{field1: 1,field2: "foo"}
2014-04-30 22:09:01	chance	they're actually called composite literals, thats the correct term
2014-04-30 22:09:01	mythmon	borcean: your use of | as a separator seems odd to me. it seems too short to visualize distinguish neighbors.
2014-04-30 22:09:14	chance	the other option is a function that initalizes an object with whatever special needs you have
2014-04-30 22:09:18	muricula	huh
2014-04-30 22:09:54	muricula	but you can't make that function be called whenever a new object is allocated, right?
2014-04-30 22:10:06	chance	generally convention is func NewFoo(arg1 int, arg2 string) {}
2014-04-30 22:10:10	chance	nope
2014-04-30 22:10:14	chance	just normal functions
2014-04-30 22:10:23	chance	its meant to be simple
2014-04-30 22:10:31	borcean	mythmon: You're right it is Computer Systems
2014-04-30 22:10:44	muricula	I need to put my brain back into C mode from C++ mode
2014-04-30 22:10:48	chance	yep
2014-04-30 22:11:15	mythmon	borcean: if you have a website or a github (with stuff), I would include that. Those are things I look for when I do interviews, and google for if they aren't listed. (This is when I interview for coding positions though)
2014-04-30 22:11:21	mythmon	if you don't have either, that's fine
2014-04-30 22:11:42	mythmon	I do recommend putting any interesting projects you work on in the future on github though :)
2014-04-30 22:11:49	chance	muricula: its nice in some ways because with constructors, you only have one
2014-04-30 22:11:56	chance	like in python you define an __init__
2014-04-30 22:12:09	chance	but what happens if you want two ways to construct a new object
2014-04-30 22:12:13	mythmon	borcean: I think your wording is good.
2014-04-30 22:12:29	borcean	mython: I do not have anything on my GitHub at the moment, but when I do I'll be sure to put a mention to it on my resume :)
2014-04-30 22:12:33	mythmon	I would put periods on the bullet points, but that is minor. It is good you are consistent.
2014-04-30 22:12:35	chance	you usually setup the init function to be the most generic, and write functions and kwargs to do things
2014-04-30 22:12:49	mythmon	borcean: a tip with irc: if you press tab in the middle of someone's name, it will complete it.
2014-04-30 22:13:19	chance	but in Go its one way, either create a new object with its default zero values, explicitly set the struct values, or use a function which does these things some other way
2014-04-30 22:13:27	mythmon	borcean: I would be very surprised if this resume doesn't get you an interview at the OSL.
2014-04-30 22:14:48	<--	bojih (80c10828@gateway/web/freenode/ip.128.193.8.40) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2014-04-30 22:14:50	mythmon	on another note, "NGP VAN database software" won't me a lot to many people. maybe explain it more, rephrase it, or leave that part out (unless you expect your audience to know what that is)
2014-04-30 22:15:06	borcean	mythmon: Haha I had periods but chucked them after consulting my writing textbook :P  And thanks for the tip!
2014-04-30 22:15:22	mythmon	borcean: I am not a writing textbook.
2014-04-30 22:15:37	mythmon	I don't think anyone will look at this and get angry about periods or a lack of periods.
2014-04-30 22:16:09	borcean	mythmon: No, you are much better than a writing textbook <3
2014-04-30 22:25:45	edunham	borcean: taking a look at the resume... the middle two lines of the technical experience section are, like, half of what we'll look at
2014-04-30 22:26:05	edunham	or more accurately, half of what i personally would look at to get a feel for whether you have technical ability/aptitude
2014-04-30 22:26:23	edunham	also the pipes in your font are indistinguishable from the letter I and it makes the job titles hard to parse
2014-04-30 22:26:36	edunham	also if you have a github account, that's a lot more interesting to us than where you live
2014-04-30 22:27:06	edunham	like, we assume you're in commuting distance of corvallis since you're an on-campus OSU student
2014-04-30 22:28:21	edunham	also every line with "campaign" in it in the leadership section makes me go "uhh what does this... how's that measurable..." though that's 'cause i have no experience related to campaign things
2014-04-30 22:29:58	spectralsun	 /w 11
2014-04-30 22:30:46	jnoah	spectralsun: winning!
2014-04-30 22:31:17	spectralsun	jnoah: hows the view?
2014-04-30 22:32:36	jnoah	great!
2014-04-30 22:32:41	jnoah	just saw saturn
2014-04-30 22:33:28	borcean	edunham: Thanks! I will definitely swap out the pipe to make it more readable, and I do not have a github with any projects. And you give a good point, those lines are a bit vauge. I'm going to try and make that more specific and try to tie it in. :)
2014-04-30 22:34:26	muricula	chance: how do I do: int* arr = new int[length] in go?
2014-04-30 22:34:40	muricula	I tried s.data = make([]int, length)
2014-04-30 22:36:45	chance	muricula: arr := make([]int, length)
2014-04-30 22:37:03	jnoah	:=(
2014-04-30 22:37:57	muricula	chance: no le gusta: ./stack.go:10: non-name s.data on left side of :=
2014-04-30 22:37:57	muricula	./stack.go:10: cannot use make([]int, length) (type []int) as type *[]int in assignment
2014-04-30 22:38:08	-->	localhost00 (~lo@2602:43:2952:6f00::1) has joined #osu-lug
2014-04-30 22:38:16	chance	http://play.golang.org/p/vdjQCBLCJ4
2014-04-30 22:38:49	chance	why are you making it a pointer?
2014-04-30 22:39:56	chance	anyways
2014-04-30 22:40:19	chance	s.data is not new
2014-04-30 22:40:23	chance	so you wouldn't use :=
2014-04-30 22:40:25	chance	you'd use =
2014-04-30 22:40:48	muricula	http://play.golang.org/p/iW5EmXAsui
2014-04-30 22:41:00	muricula	that's what I'm trying to do
2014-04-30 22:43:04	chance	ah
2014-04-30 22:43:13	chance	first, do you want a pointer to a list or a list of pointers
2014-04-30 22:43:23	muricula	A pointer to a list
2014-04-30 22:43:25	chance	i assume the prior
2014-04-30 22:43:31	--	localhost00 is now known as Weyoun
2014-04-30 22:43:58	chance	then you dont really need a pointer here.
2014-04-30 22:44:09	chance	slices are reference types already
2014-04-30 22:44:16	muricula	don't I want it on the heap?
2014-04-30 22:45:07	chance	http://play.golang.org/p/RJqRLP27yF
2014-04-30 22:45:11	chance	its already on the heap
2014-04-30 22:45:37	chance	slices use arrays underneath, and have references to the arrays they use for their actual storage
2014-04-30 22:46:05	muricula	so wait you can reference things which are on the heap but aren't pointers?
2014-04-30 22:46:46	chance	http://play.golang.org/p/8k33Sf-whE
2014-04-30 22:46:54	chance	stop thinking in terms of heap/stack
2014-04-30 22:47:04	chance	in Go your not allocating memory, you have no control of where things are allocated
2014-04-30 22:47:06	muricula	Yeah I know
2014-04-30 22:47:07	 *	Weyoun suddenly feels empathic towards students in his class who feel they have no clue what is going on.
2014-04-30 22:47:14	chance	pointers are just references to values
2014-04-30 22:47:19	chance	like normal pointers
2014-04-30 22:47:40	Weyoun	(Well, okay, it’s not like I never had that clue.)
2014-04-30 22:47:43	chance	take a look at that last link
2014-04-30 22:47:50	-->	bojih (80c10828@gateway/web/freenode/ip.128.193.8.40) has joined #osu-lug
2014-04-30 22:47:57	chance	i update data, which also updates the s.data value
2014-04-30 22:48:16	chance	also notice line 12
2014-04-30 22:48:24	chance	you dont really need to use the word new very much
2014-04-30 22:49:09	muricula	chance++ go++
2014-04-30 22:50:33	chance	yah, glad to help
2014-04-30 22:50:45	muricula	I will have other questions
2014-04-30 22:51:24	chance	sure
2014-04-30 22:51:34	chance	http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html is my favorite reference, i continue to use it day to day with Go
2014-04-30 22:51:44	chance	it explains things the way ive learned, and have been conveying
2014-04-30 22:53:02	chance	http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#data
2014-04-30 22:53:10	chance	explains the uses of new, and make a bit better than i explained
2014-04-30 22:55:42	chance	general things: rarely use var
2014-04-30 22:55:57	chance	i just use empty composite literals
2014-04-30 22:56:06	chance	thats how docker folks liked it at least
2014-04-30 22:56:57	chance	new is really just for giving you a pointer to a value with its values zeroed out
2014-04-30 22:57:47	chance	also, always use slices instead of arrays
2014-04-30 22:57:59	chance	there isnt really a case to use arrays pretty much ever
2014-04-30 23:04:37	muricula	dang, no overloading.
2014-04-30 23:05:26	chance	nope
2014-04-30 23:05:34	chance	interfaces help with that
2014-04-30 23:06:03	muricula	thanks
2014-04-30 23:06:03	chance	make an interface, implement it for the things you want, call functions which expect the interface using their specific method
2014-04-30 23:06:24	muricula	oh, like an interface for "bag" and "stack"
2014-04-30 23:06:27	muricula	I should do that
2014-04-30 23:07:14	chance	yeah, a stack should have methods pop, push, length
2014-04-30 23:07:16	chance	ect
2014-04-30 23:07:55	chance	then other implementations can implement those methods differently (not overloading, but meh)
2014-04-30 23:08:09	muricula	I assume that I can't declare fields of a struct private, etc.
2014-04-30 23:09:01	chance	well you can but its using capitalization
2014-04-30 23:09:22	chance	methods/attributes which begin with caps are public
2014-04-30 23:09:36	chance	if they're not capitalized their private to the package they're defined in
2014-04-30 23:09:57	muricula	oh, so I would implement Push, Pop, and resize
2014-04-30 23:10:04	chance	yes
2014-04-30 23:10:12	chance	if you dont want resize to be exposed to anything else
2014-04-30 23:10:31	chance	the non public methods/functions in a package can be used by anything in the same package, just not outside of the package
2014-04-30 23:10:36	chance	check this out
2014-04-30 23:10:39	chance	http://golang.org/src/pkg/container/list/list.go
2014-04-30 23:10:49	chance	go's stdlib is amazingly documented
2014-04-30 23:10:56	chance	http://golang.org/src/pkg/container/heap/heap.go too
2014-04-30 23:14:46	chance	also, you might notice
2014-04-30 23:14:53	chance	the comments in the code are used in godoc
2014-04-30 23:14:55	chance	for docs
2014-04-30 23:15:12	chance	its like python doc strings
2014-04-30 23:15:19	chance	except theyre not special, just normal comments
2014-04-30 23:15:43	muricula	do I put them right below the first line of a function like in python?
2014-04-30 23:16:01	chance	before
2014-04-30 23:16:10	chance	check the examples i just linked and their corresponding docs page
2014-04-30 23:16:52	chance	golang.org/pkg/container/list -> golang.org/src/pkg/container/list/list.go
2014-04-30 23:17:00	muricula	okay. And gdoc comments aren't in markdown or anything special right?
2014-04-30 23:18:53	chance	nope
2014-04-30 23:18:58	chance	http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary
2014-04-30 23:19:30	chance	Comments that appear before top-level declarations, with no intervening newlines, are extracted along with the declaration to serve as explanatory text for the item.
2014-04-30 23:19:52	chance	 The comments are uninterpreted plain text, so HTML and other annotations such as _this_ will reproduce verbatim
2014-04-30 23:21:22	chance	seriously effective_go is awesome :)
2014-04-30 23:21:38	chance	i still read it and learn new things :D
2014-04-30 23:21:52	chance	like the recommendation to start comments that describe functions with the name of the function
2014-04-30 23:22:01	chance	so you can run godoc | grep SomeFuncName
2014-04-30 23:22:15	muricula	no assertions?
2014-04-30 23:22:30	muricula	Well that means my prototype will fail silently.
2014-04-30 23:22:54	chance	hmm?
2014-04-30 23:23:14	chance	you can assert, in tests
2014-04-30 23:23:18	muricula	well apparently there are no assertions
2014-04-30 23:23:24	chance	use an if statement
2014-04-30 23:23:30	chance	if you want to return an error
2014-04-30 23:23:34	chance	return a named variable error
2014-04-30 23:23:51	muricula	huh?
2014-04-30 23:24:54	chance	var ErrFoo = errors.New("some descriptive string")
2014-04-30 23:25:04	chance	then in your function, if you were to assert
2014-04-30 23:25:08	chance	instead return nil, ErrFoo
2014-04-30 23:25:23	chance	if a function *can* fail, instead of returning one arg, return 2, one for the value, one for the error
2014-04-30 23:27:31	chance	if there is no error
2014-04-30 23:27:38	chance	then return someval, nil
2014-04-30 23:27:59	mythmon	Go, ladies and gentlemen.
2014-04-30 23:28:56	chance	explicit ;)
2014-04-30 23:29:04	chance	glad i dont have to worry about possible exceptions anymore.
2014-04-30 23:29:13	mythmon	Java did that too :P
2014-04-30 23:29:40	mythmon	uncaught exceptions declared exceptions are a compiler error.
2014-04-30 23:29:50	mythmon	but I shouldn't make fun of languages considering what i just wrote.
2014-04-30 23:30:01	muricula	what did you just write?
2014-04-30 23:30:17	mythmon	something that "pretty" prints monte lexer errors.
2014-04-30 23:30:31	muricula	lexer errors can't be pretty
2014-04-30 23:30:35	muricula	I'm sorry
2014-04-30 23:30:35	mythmon	https://pastebin.mozilla.org/5026253
2014-04-30 23:30:51	mythmon	the output is fairly pretty, IMO.
2014-04-30 23:30:55	mythmon	the code on the other hand...
2014-04-30 23:32:54	irdan	does anyone have experience with parallel python?
2014-04-30 23:33:10	mythmon	irdan: maybe, who's asking?
2014-04-30 23:33:38	irdan	mythmon: haha, i am.  I'm trying to make use of a read-only variable without copying it into each thread
2014-04-30 23:33:54	mythmon	irdan: you probably don't want to use threads.
2014-04-30 23:34:19	mythmon	i also think you don't understand threads, based on that question.
2014-04-30 23:34:47	irdan	sorry, i meant processes
2014-04-30 23:34:59	mythmon	how are you spawning processes?
2014-04-30 23:35:03	irdan	using pp
2014-04-30 23:35:06	mythmon	pp?
2014-04-30 23:35:25	irdan	http://www.parallelpython.com/
2014-04-30 23:35:25	mythmon	that makes me think of the pprint module, which i think is not what you are talking about.
2014-04-30 23:35:43	mythmon	oh. when you said "parallel python" I thought you meant "doing concurrency in python"
2014-04-30 23:35:47	mythmon	I have no experience with this thing.
2014-04-30 23:36:09	irdan	i'm open to other libriaries if you have a suggestion
2014-04-30 23:36:17	mythmon	what are you doing?
2014-04-30 23:36:19	bryon	Valley Library
2014-04-30 23:36:22	irdan	basically, i have a 7.5 gig hash table that I don't want to copy
2014-04-30 23:36:32	bryon	Corvallis Public Library
2014-04-30 23:36:34	irdan	i'm trying to find partial md5 collisions
2014-04-30 23:36:36	bryon	Library of Congress
2014-04-30 23:36:41	 *	bryon is helping.
2014-04-30 23:36:43	mythmon	that's not how multi processes work.
2014-04-30 23:36:47	mythmon	bryon: wat
2014-04-30 23:36:50	bryon	heh
2014-04-30 23:36:54	chance	irdan: are you writing to it?
2014-04-30 23:36:58	irdan	no
2014-04-30 23:37:03	chance	just reading?
2014-04-30 23:37:08	irdan	i write it ahead of time
2014-04-30 23:37:15	chance	so no concurrent reading
2014-04-30 23:37:17	chance	errr
2014-04-30 23:37:20	chance	no concurrent writing*
2014-04-30 23:37:22	chance	?
2014-04-30 23:37:24	irdan	correct
2014-04-30 23:37:26	chance	you can use a global
2014-04-30 23:37:28	mythmon	chance: no
2014-04-30 23:37:30	chance	no need to lock on it
2014-04-30 23:37:33	mythmon	chance: multiprocess, not multithread
2014-04-30 23:37:36	mythmon	because this is python.
2014-04-30 23:37:37	chance	oh right
2014-04-30 23:37:41	chance	hmm
2014-04-30 23:37:42	irdan	also pp doesn't let you use globals
2014-04-30 23:37:57	irdan	and i can pass in the variable, but then it just makes n copies of my hash table
2014-04-30 23:38:02	mythmon	irdan: so, you break up the huge table into chunks, then assign each worker a chunk?
2014-04-30 23:38:05	_Alice_	wow windows
2014-04-30 23:38:06	_Alice_	just
2014-04-30 23:38:15	_Alice_	i used your diskpart tool and you can't install to the drive
2014-04-30 23:38:18	_Alice_	and it works fine for Linux
2014-04-30 23:38:29	mythmon	irdan: or do you need the entire thing for each worker?
2014-04-30 23:38:38	chance	that was my next suggestion
2014-04-30 23:38:43	chance	if you can break it up
2014-04-30 23:38:47	chance	and assign each piece to a worker
2014-04-30 23:38:54	_Alice_	might get an SSD
2014-04-30 23:38:57	chance	the other thing i was thinking was a shared memory object
2014-04-30 23:38:59	mythmon	_Alice_: mmm... ssd
2014-04-30 23:39:09	mythmon	oh, i forgot shared memory was a thing.
2014-04-30 23:39:11	_Alice_	expensive
2014-04-30 23:39:14	_Alice_	like
2014-04-30 23:39:15	irdan	i'm making a giant dict of hashes, then each process makes random md5's that will try to match any 1 entry in the dict
2014-04-30 23:39:17	_Alice_	too expensive
2014-04-30 23:39:39	irdan	mythmon: yes, the whole thing makes the likelyhood of a collision much higher
2014-04-30 23:39:42	_Alice_	but a 64 GB is like 50
2014-04-30 23:40:05	mythmon	irdan: hmm
2014-04-30 23:40:06	irdan	shared memory sounds like it might work for me
2014-04-30 23:40:12	mythmon	irdan: can i see a chunk of the 7.5G thing?
2014-04-30 23:40:17	chance	i dont see why threads wouldnt work
2014-04-30 23:40:25	chance	i mean GIL, but a lot of the time you wont be bound on that
2014-04-30 23:40:28	mythmon	chance: because threads cannot run simultaneously in python.
2014-04-30 23:40:34	chance	i know
2014-04-30 23:40:36	mythmon	chance: what? this is purely GIL blocked.
2014-04-30 23:40:39	mythmon	there is no IO.
2014-04-30 23:40:56	chance	right.
2014-04-30 23:41:16	mythmon	chance: we clearly understand the GIL differently.
2014-04-30 23:41:18	chance	was thinking computing md5's might be fine, but your right, GIL locked
2014-04-30 23:41:26	irdan	mythmon: http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7041/
2014-04-30 23:41:38	chance	mythmon: no im just dumb
2014-04-30 23:41:40	irdan	that's how i generate the dict of partial hashes
2014-04-30 23:41:41	chance	wasnt thinking
2014-04-30 23:41:41	mythmon	chance: ok.
2014-04-30 23:42:08	chance	you could do a producer/consumer model
2014-04-30 23:42:29	mythmon	irdan: so you have a huge dict of message -> hashes, and you want to find a message that collides?
2014-04-30 23:42:30	chance	consumer is one or more processes which have pipes
2014-04-30 23:42:38	irdan	mythmon: correct
2014-04-30 23:42:39	chance	you send hashes to each consumer
2014-04-30 23:42:41	chance	over a pipe
2014-04-30 23:42:48	mythmon	irdan: i think that chance's idea is a good one
2014-04-30 23:42:59	jnoah	mythmon: rust is fun
2014-04-30 23:43:00	chance	if a consumer doesnt find the hash in it's chunk of the hashes
2014-04-30 23:43:07	chance	then you send it to the next consumer
2014-04-30 23:43:07	mythmon	oh, wait.
2014-04-30 23:43:13	chance	multi consumer is hard
2014-04-30 23:43:14	mythmon	nevermind, i think chance and i have different ideas.
2014-04-30 23:43:18	chance	but one consumer works well
2014-04-30 23:43:29	mythmon	what I would do: one master, many workers.
2014-04-30 23:43:38	irdan	chance: the entire hash must be available to each process
2014-04-30 23:43:41	mythmon	each worker generates a block of message -> hash pairs, and then sends them to the master.
2014-04-30 23:43:46	mythmon	the master collates them and checks for collisions.
2014-04-30 23:43:48	chance	irdan: not in my  case
2014-04-30 23:44:16	chance	you would have each process except the consumer have some portion of the hash
2014-04-30 23:44:25	mythmon	the the hard, parralelizable part (the md5) is done on many workers, and the memory intensive, linear part is done on the master.
2014-04-30 23:44:29	chance	err
2014-04-30 23:44:37	chance	yeah
2014-04-30 23:44:37	irdan	hmm
2014-04-30 23:44:39	chance	what mythmon said
2014-04-30 23:44:44	chance	is what i was trying to say in one case
2014-04-30 23:44:48	mythmon	chance: i think your's is like a token ring?
2014-04-30 23:44:52	chance	mythmon: kind of
2014-04-30 23:44:55	jnoah	ugh, i think nightly broke vimperator :(
2014-04-30 23:44:58	chance	you can just expand yours into multiple masters
2014-04-30 23:44:59	irdan	mythmon: yea that sounds like it would work
2014-04-30 23:45:02	chance	but then they need to communicate
2014-04-30 23:45:03	mythmon	ok. I'm suggesting a star topology.
2014-04-30 23:45:09	chance	which makes it way more complicated
2014-04-30 23:45:24	irdan	so, uh, i have no idea how to implement that
2014-04-30 23:45:27	mythmon	workers only communicate with the master, and messages never go from a worker to another worker (even through the master
2014-04-30 23:45:36	mythmon	irdan: multiprocess in the standard lib.
2014-04-30 23:45:37	irdan	any resources you would suggest?
2014-04-30 23:45:38	chance	irdan: CS311
2014-04-30 23:45:45	irdan	chance: thanks for clearing that up
2014-04-30 23:45:45	chance	you remember multi threaded sieve?
2014-04-30 23:45:48	mythmon	irdan: https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html
2014-04-30 23:45:58	chance	well parrallel sieve
2014-04-30 23:46:05	chance	its like that
2014-04-30 23:46:07	chance	instead of marking primes
2014-04-30 23:46:13	chance	each process generates SHA1s
2014-04-30 23:46:18	chance	or mp5s i mean
2014-04-30 23:46:22	chance	md5*
2014-04-30 23:46:31	chance	and then you send them into the master process over a pipe
2014-04-30 23:46:51	chance	you can use select on a bunch of pipes, right mythmon ?
2014-04-30 23:46:54	mythmon	irdan: look at the "Pipes and Queues" section and the "Using a pool of workers" example.
2014-04-30 23:46:54	irdan	wow, i wish i knew python made it this easy before i started using pp
2014-04-30 23:46:57	_Alice_	urgh
2014-04-30 23:47:00	mythmon	chance: something like that, I think.
2014-04-30 23:47:04	_Alice_	i don't want to have to buy another hard drive..
2014-04-30 23:47:15	_Alice_	WINDOWS WHY DO YOU SUCK SO MUCH
2014-04-30 23:47:29	irdan	mythmon chance thanks!

2014-04-30 23:47:43	jnoah	:/
2014-04-30 23:48:05	mythmon	_Alice_: could it be the partition table?

2014-04-30 23:48:28	muricula	I think that's what jnoah wanted
2014-04-30 23:48:33	jnoah	muricula: more of a code of conduct issue rather than language though
2014-04-30 23:48:49	muricula	oh, sorry, my bad.
2014-04-30 23:48:57	mythmon	i think we can have one conversation without invoking those !commands.
2014-04-30 23:49:13	muricula	yeah, sorry I apologize, _Alice_ mythmon 
2014-04-30 23:49:28	jnoah	mythmon: it would be nice, wouldn't it
2014-04-30 23:51:05	muricula	I just looked at what jnoah did and tried what I thought was the proper command. I was wrong.
2014-04-30 23:51:17	mythmon	muricula: oh sure.
2014-04-30 23:51:28	chance	so blackboards still down wtffff
2014-04-30 23:52:19	chance	how am i supposed to study :\
2014-04-30 23:52:24	chance	i have a midterm tomorrow.
2014-04-30 23:52:29	_Alice_	mythmon: it's msddos
2014-04-30 23:52:31	_Alice_	msdos
2014-04-30 23:52:33	_Alice_	and
2014-04-30 23:52:35	_Alice_	i use DiskPart
2014-04-30 23:52:38	mythmon	_Alice_: that sounds like a good value.
2014-04-30 23:52:47	mythmon	sure DiskPart should be just as good.
2014-04-30 23:52:48	_Alice_	http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-2-5-Inch-SV300S37A-120G/dp/B00A1ZTZOG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1398926139&sr=8-3&keywords=128GB+SSD
2014-04-30 23:53:11	mythmon	I've had times where windows didn't like drives because partition tables. if you don't have anything valuable on it, might be worth a short.
2014-04-30 23:53:18	mythmon	ooh, that's a very low price for an ssd, and nice reviews.
2014-04-30 23:53:27	_Alice_	oh i shredded the drive
2014-04-30 23:53:35	mythmon	easy answer then.
2014-04-30 23:53:35	_Alice_	and created a new one
2014-04-30 23:53:38	_Alice_	more than one time
2014-04-30 23:53:42	mythmon	ah, ok.
2014-04-30 23:53:46	mythmon	i'm out of ideas though.
2014-04-30 23:53:46	_Alice_	and even formatted to NTFS in gparted
2014-04-30 23:53:49	mythmon	s/though/then/
2014-04-30 23:53:50	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: i'm out of ideas then.
2014-04-30 23:53:53	_Alice_	sme
2014-04-30 23:53:53	 *	hamper holds out an 'a' and says "you dropped something"
2014-04-30 23:53:57	muricula	_Alice_: would shredding a ssd be bad for it?
2014-04-30 23:54:01	_Alice_	yes
2014-04-30 23:54:09	_Alice_	because the read write limits
2014-04-30 23:54:11	_Alice_	just encrypt it
2014-04-30 23:54:13	mythmon	muricula: reduces it's lifetime, but SSDs have gotten better.
2014-04-30 23:54:14	_Alice_	that's what i will do
2014-04-30 23:54:35	 *	Weyoun swipes the ‘a’ from hamper
2014-04-30 23:54:53	mythmon	also, for example, a 240GB SSD is probably actually 256GB worth of nand, and it uses the extra 16GB for when blocks go bad.
2014-04-30 23:54:58	_Alice_	also it may not actually shred all files
2014-04-30 23:55:03	mythmon	and/or for wear leveling.
2014-04-30 23:55:05	_Alice_	since an SSD has redundant bits
2014-04-30 23:55:19	_Alice_	so you have to just encrypt
2014-04-30 23:55:43	mythmon	_Alice_: do you know anything about encryption and TRIM support?
2014-04-30 23:55:48	_Alice_	n
2014-04-30 23:55:52	 *	mythmon shrugs
2014-04-30 23:56:02	_Alice_	sorry
2014-04-30 23:56:04	mythmon	I think encryption makes trim impossible, but i hope not.
2014-04-30 23:56:05	mythmon	no worries.
2014-04-30 23:56:17	_Alice_	my only real isue is theft
2014-04-30 23:56:19	_Alice_	or tampering
2014-04-30 23:56:32	_Alice_	issue
2014-04-30 23:57:02	jnoah	mythmon: i think TRIM should still work with encryption
2014-04-30 23:57:05	mythmon	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Specialties#Discard.2FTRIM_support_for_solid_state_drives_.28SSD.29
2014-04-30 23:57:06	mythmon	i found that
2014-04-30 23:57:12	jnoah	wait
2014-04-30 23:57:15	jnoah	nvm
2014-04-30 23:57:20	mythmon	it says that trim is off by default under dmcrypt because it can leak security info.
2014-04-30 23:57:29	jnoah	"When software-based disk encryption is in use, using the Trim command reveals information about which blocks are in use and which are not"
2014-04-30 23:57:35	mythmon	or rather, it can leak info. though not a lot.
2014-04-30 23:57:35	jnoah	yeah
2014-04-30 23:57:53	jnoah	(wikipedia page)
2014-04-30 23:58:01	mythmon	so... not horrible, but certain levels of paranoia would not be allow for that.

2014-05-01 00:14:34	jnoah	mythmon: have you played with rust much?
2014-05-01 00:14:47	mythmon	jnoah: a littile.
2014-05-01 00:14:52	mythmon	little, even.
2014-05-01 00:15:14	jnoah	ah, i'm going through http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial.html currently
2014-05-01 00:15:25	mythmon	nice
2014-05-01 00:15:35	muricula	jnoah: did you like rust by example? It was the best one I found.
2014-05-01 00:15:46	mythmon	i went through all of that at some point. i think they have added more since then.
2014-05-01 00:15:58	jnoah	muricula: still going through that as well, i don't have rust setup on the machine i'm currently on though
2014-05-01 00:16:31	jnoah	[7 Destructors] maybe i'm out of practice for stuff like this, but are these actually needed?
2014-05-01 00:16:49	muricula	Destructors? If you have real OO, definitly
2014-05-01 00:17:08	muricula	what if you want to remove memory allocated to the heap? 
2014-05-01 00:17:16	jnoah	idunno, python is magic
2014-05-01 00:17:34	muricula	Although with a garbage collector you don't need any of it.
2014-05-01 00:17:48	jnoah	mm, true
2014-05-01 00:18:42	 *	jnoah is used to all that stuff being handled for him
2014-05-01 00:21:10	_Alice_	well i ordered an SSD
2014-05-01 00:21:47	mythmon	jnoah: were you around for the RAII conversation we had recently?
2014-05-01 00:22:49	mythmon	destructors enable RAII.
2014-05-01 00:22:49	jnoah	i don't believe so
2014-05-01 00:22:58	jnoah	what is RAII?
2014-05-01 00:23:21	mythmon	Resource Acquisition is Initialization
2014-05-01 00:23:28	jnoah	ah
2014-05-01 00:23:58	mythmon	constructors may allocate memory, open files, listen on sockets.
2014-05-01 00:24:13	mythmon	destructors clean up all that.
2014-05-01 00:24:42	mythmon	and get calles automatically when they should be.
2014-05-01 00:25:07	mythmon	that's the high level idea, anyway.
2014-05-01 00:28:12	_Alice_	haha..
2014-05-01 00:28:21	_Alice_	i am glad i learned C++ first
2014-05-01 00:28:26	jnoah	hmm, relabeling of things is interesting.
2014-05-01 00:29:31	jnoah	let x = ~5; let y = x.clone(); let z = x; // no new memory allocated, `x` can no longer be used
2014-05-01 00:29:48	jnoah	x is considered uninitialized
2014-05-01 00:29:55	mythmon	_Alice_: this is al pretty normal in C++, yes?
2014-05-01 00:30:01	jnoah	(z = x does that)
2014-05-01 00:30:02	_Alice_	syntax is different
2014-05-01 00:30:07	_Alice_	but rust is close to C++
2014-05-01 00:30:19	_Alice_	i still prefer C++ but i know it better
2014-05-01 00:30:22	mythmon	jnoah: right. because Rust does moves be default.
2014-05-01 00:30:46	mythmon	you could do let y = &x.
2014-05-01 00:30:59	jnoah	ah
2014-05-01 00:31:12	mythmon	which is kind of a pointer.
2014-05-01 00:32:03	_Alice_	i should actually learn rust.
2014-05-01 00:32:08	_Alice_	and get decent with it
2014-05-01 00:32:10	_Alice_	but i like ruby
2014-05-01 00:32:30	jnoah	_Alice_: rust seems really fun
2014-05-01 00:32:38	jnoah	ML + C = Rust; it seems
2014-05-01 00:33:04	_Alice_	C <3
2014-05-01 00:33:22	muricula	No, C > 3
2014-05-01 00:33:36	jnoah	mythmon: where would unsafe operations be useful in rust?
2014-05-01 00:33:46	jnoah	(why is that even an option?)
2014-05-01 00:33:54	mythmon	jnoah: ffi
2014-05-01 00:34:06	jnoah	ah, that makes sense
2014-05-01 00:34:10	mythmon	ie, dealing with C/Cpp code.
2014-05-01 00:34:17	jnoah	yeah
2014-05-01 00:34:28	mythmon	also, i think it is needed with kernel stuff.
2014-05-01 00:34:31	jnoah	doesn't haskell do that purely though?
2014-05-01 00:34:38	muricula	jnoah: if I wanted to rewrite my kernel in rust I would need to call assembly instructions (like this one http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/i386/LGDT.htm), which are necessarily unsafe
2014-05-01 00:34:57	mythmon	jnoah: mu
2014-05-01 00:35:03	muricula	mu?
2014-05-01 00:35:11	jnoah	^
2014-05-01 00:35:20	_Alice_	>rewriting a kernel
2014-05-01 00:35:21	mythmon	rust safety != haskell purity.
2014-05-01 00:35:38	jnoah	true, i was just curious
2014-05-01 00:35:55	jnoah	(understanding language differences, etc)
2014-05-01 00:35:57	mythmon	mu is a concept like "your question is invalid"
2014-05-01 00:36:07	vanrysss	anyone else use f.lux ?
2014-05-01 00:36:11	muricula	like the mu int GEB?
2014-05-01 00:36:11	mythmon	or, "i unask your question"
2014-05-01 00:36:23	mythmon	muricula: precisely.
2014-05-01 00:36:28	muricula	int. I've been programming a bit tonight huh?
2014-05-01 00:36:40	_Alice_	i want to be dirty
2014-05-01 00:36:47	_Alice_	maybe i should not use haskell
2014-05-01 00:36:59	pwnguin	use ocaml, it has impure functional constructs
2014-05-01 00:36:59	muricula	unsafe { _Alice_ }
2014-05-01 00:37:00	jnoah	haskell can be dirty

2014-05-01 00:38:30	_Alice_	also i hope an SSD works like people say
2014-05-01 00:38:31	mythmon	just saying, rust's safety is optional.
2014-05-01 00:38:34	_Alice_	and is fast

2014-05-01 00:39:42	pwnguin	type correctness is not, however, people who say that type correctness leads to programs that work are... unimaginitive in the ways software can fail
2014-05-01 00:48:01	muricula	Well it's like saying "my program compiled, so it must work." The only people who say that are bright eyed freshpeople who haven't seen a segfault
2014-05-01 00:48:27	_Alice_	i have
2014-05-01 00:48:28	_Alice_	had
2014-05-01 00:48:31	_Alice_	g++
2014-05-01 00:48:32	_Alice_	fucking
2014-05-01 00:48:34	_Alice_	seg fault
2014-05-01 00:49:17	_Alice_	clang is better
2014-05-01 00:49:46	_Alice_	but since you said freshpeople and segfault i had to comment
2014-05-01 00:59:58	muricula	wait, you've had the compiler segfault?
2014-05-01 01:00:11	muricula	what were you doing to the poor thing?
2014-05-01 01:02:33	_Alice_	compiling code for CS163
2014-05-01 01:03:15	muricula	what's CS163?
2014-05-01 01:03:36	jnoah	"the current element in both lists is equal" or "the current element in both lists are equal"?
2014-05-01 01:03:42	jnoah	is vs. are
2014-05-01 01:03:55	muricula	is
2014-05-01 01:04:03	muricula	the subject is the current element
2014-05-01 01:04:38	jnoah	but it's about two current elements
2014-05-01 01:05:22	muricula	Actually I think you want to say "the current elementS of both lists are equal"

2014-05-01 09:12:56	bryon	what is 255?
2014-05-01 09:13:04	jordane	vector calc 2

2014-05-01 09:13:37	BeardmanMcBeards	but doesn't hold a candle to DiffEqs + Linear Alg
2014-05-01 09:14:02	jordane	Yeah, linear algebra is my favorite subtopic in math.
2014-05-01 09:14:13	BeardmanMcBeards	using matrix decomposition techniques to solve systems of diffeqs is like math heaven
2014-05-01 09:14:28	BeardmanMcBeards	"Oh hey, want to solve an actual system in the world?  You get to finally do it!"
2014-05-01 09:14:41	BeardmanMcBeards	rather than learn how to use integrals differently for some contrived math problem
2014-05-01 09:15:06	BeardmanMcBeards	what was it....there was one topic in linear algebra that was mind-blowing in a way
2014-05-01 09:15:29	BeardmanMcBeards	swapping the x/y/z's for the constants as a means of solving the same problem but from a different perspective
2014-05-01 09:15:39	BeardmanMcBeards	apparently it get sused when you're swapping coordinate systems?
2014-05-01 09:15:57	jordane	BeardmanMcBeards: Yeah, matrix decomposition comes out of that, in a way.
2014-05-01 09:16:00	BeardmanMcBeards	like calculating where something is on the ground versus if you're in a place, but still being able to use the same data
2014-05-01 09:16:16	BeardmanMcBeards	plane*
2014-05-01 09:16:40	jordane	it's essentially using that vector spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic, and calculations in one is equivalent to calculations in any other
2014-05-01 09:16:50	jordane	so find the easiest one, do all your calculations there, and transform back.
2014-05-01 09:17:43	BeardmanMcBeards	Yeah, yeah, that's what it was
2014-05-01 09:17:56	BeardmanMcBeards	It's been almost two years since I took linear analysis =P

2014-05-01 10:02:25	Wahrheit	it works, but only for the last row

2014-05-01 10:03:44	Wahrheit	there are 1257 rows, so I need the first new ID to be 1258 and move on from there
2014-05-01 10:03:54	fridgei	make the id auto increment

2014-05-01 10:06:21	fridgei	it will just do taht for you

2014-05-01 11:04:40	rordway	andrewfree: that's how skynet will happen
2014-05-01 11:05:08	fridgei	there is no real advantage to defining a proc in a proc you could write lambdas instead

2014-05-01 13:24:14	salvatoz	virtualbox crashes every time I try closing a VM. can anyone recommend a FOSS alternative, preferably with the ability to save machine states?
2014-05-01 13:25:29	mathuin	docker may work for you, as may vagrant.
2014-05-01 13:26:27	Alan_S	vagrant used virtualbox by default
2014-05-01 13:26:36	mathuin	Thus the may.
2014-05-01 13:26:37	Alan_S	what are you using the vms for?
2014-05-01 13:28:16	_Alice_	hmm
2014-05-01 13:29:16	_Alice_	bryon: it's a class i took like 3 years ago
2014-05-01 13:29:17	_Alice_	maybe 4
2014-05-01 13:29:24	salvatoz	I'm running mint as a guest under windows so I can do schoolwork and work from home without dual booting, but this issue is making me consider installing mint instead of OS X as my second OS
2014-05-01 13:31:01	salvatoz	is it possible that virtualbox would be more stable under linux? my pc is pretty beefy so windows as a guest for gaming is an option I'd consider
2014-05-01 13:31:26	_Alice_	define beefy
2014-05-01 13:31:40	_Alice_	because unless you're running some pretty huge hardware i wouldn't
2014-05-01 13:31:45	salvatoz	i5-4670k, 16GB RAM, r9 280x
2014-05-01 13:31:54	_Alice_	well that is beefy
2014-05-01 13:32:04	_Alice_	still not sure i would try it
2014-05-01 13:32:09	Alan_S	gaming in a vm is hard to make work
2014-05-01 13:32:13	_Alice_	^
2014-05-01 13:32:25	mathuin	I had trouble using Microsoft Office in a VM on my i5 16G RAM system
2014-05-01 13:32:30	mathuin	I can't imagine playing video games.
2014-05-01 13:32:40	_Alice_	i had trouble running the OS
2014-05-01 13:33:05	salvatoz	that's annoying. I've had a couple people tell me they've done gaming in a vm so I assumed it would be easier
2014-05-01 13:33:13	salvatoz	I just really don't want to have to dual boot
2014-05-01 13:33:19	muricula	really? I used to do development on a VM running windows, and it wasn't that bad.
2014-05-01 13:33:29	_Alice_	muricula: on what hardware??
2014-05-01 13:33:43	muricula	probably like what you described, I don't recall
2014-05-01 13:33:48	_Alice_	i did it on a amcbook pro and it was barely usable
2014-05-01 13:34:03	salvatoz	mathuin __Alice__: what gpu and were you using software rendering or hardware?
2014-05-01 13:34:03	mathuin	What kind of development?  I can run vi and python and all that stuff, I just couldn't run Word.
2014-05-01 13:34:13	_Alice_	Windows is slow normally on moden hardware.
2014-05-01 13:34:15	muricula	I was running QT creator and visual studio and doing windows builds
2014-05-01 13:34:20	mathuin	A relatively recent NVIDIA card, 5xx Ti or something?
2014-05-01 13:34:28	_Alice_	i was running on an i5
2014-05-01 13:34:39	_Alice_	with intel HD4000 inegrated graphics
2014-05-01 13:34:46	Alan_S	you would have to do pcie passthrough of the graphics card to the vm and then the host would not be able to use it
2014-05-01 13:34:47	rordway	salvatoz: depends on the game. anything that needs quick response time is going to be a problem on a VM
2014-05-01 13:34:51	_Alice_	i use a 560 GTX
2014-05-01 13:34:59	rordway	unless you're ok with 5-10fps :)
2014-05-01 13:35:14	mathuin	Counter-Strike: Slide Show
2014-05-01 13:35:20	_Alice_	>playing a game below 60FPS
2014-05-01 13:35:21	jnoah	imo amd > nvidea (doge mining ftw)
2014-05-01 13:35:27	_Alice_	enjoy never being able to play multiplayer
2014-05-01 13:35:33	mathuin	I <3 my Nvidia card for OpenCL.
2014-05-01 13:35:38	_Alice_	NVidia is better for gaming
2014-05-01 13:35:54	_Alice_	and AMD is best for processors
2014-05-01 13:35:56	mathuin	The Linux support at least seemed better based on what I was reading.
2014-05-01 13:36:11	_Alice_	cause they don't use their employees and cut cornersd in cpu manufacture
2014-05-01 13:36:12	_Alice_	ing
2014-05-01 13:36:20	jnoah	yeah, nvidia > amd for linux support, by far
2014-05-01 13:36:24	salvatoz	I think I might just try getting mint set up on my second ssd and seeing how the vm handles when I get around to it. I don't care about gaming enough to need to have the ability to do so at all times, but it would be nice.
2014-05-01 13:37:28	Alan_S	there are other hypervisor for windows you could use but I dont know of any other good open source ones
2014-05-01 13:37:54	salvatoz	that's the problem. I've seen a couple random projects but they look even less developed than virtualbox, so not really an improvement
2014-05-01 13:37:58	salvatoz	no way am I using vmware
2014-05-01 13:38:05	terrellt	Don't people generally run things through WINE for gaming off-PC?
2014-05-01 13:38:16	_Alice_	Wine is bad for playing games
2014-05-01 13:38:17	_Alice_	well
2014-05-01 13:38:22	_Alice_	it's the best worst thing
2014-05-01 13:38:24	_Alice_	you can do
2014-05-01 13:38:25	bryon	personally, i think WINE is just bad
2014-05-01 13:38:29	salvatoz	wine is okay at some games and worse at others
2014-05-01 13:38:30	_Alice_	because most games use DirectX
2014-05-01 13:38:33	bryon	i've never been successful with it
2014-05-01 13:38:36	_Alice_	you have to em,ulate it to OpenGL
2014-05-01 13:38:38	_Alice_	so it sucks
2014-05-01 13:38:41	mathuin	I think WINE is bad in the same way that NAT is bad -- it's a necessary evil.
2014-05-01 13:38:50	_Alice_	NAT is good
2014-05-01 13:38:54	edunham	(best worst thing)++
2014-05-01 13:38:54	_Alice_	better than ipv6
2014-05-01 13:38:56	bryon	wine, on the other hand, is pretty great in many respects
2014-05-01 13:39:01	salvatoz	I mean, the GTA san andreas os x port is just a wine wrapper
2014-05-01 13:39:12	Alan_S	I have been able to get most of the games i play running in wine but not all, its really hit and miss
2014-05-01 13:39:15	salvatoz	same with some other games
2014-05-01 13:39:33	mathuin	Eh, I disagree re: NAT and IPv6.  I'd much much much rather deploy the latter than the former, all things being equal.
2014-05-01 13:39:33	_Alice_	Alan_S: i havel ike 1 or 2 that do
2014-05-01 13:39:41	_Alice_	and good games like Deus Ex
2014-05-01 13:39:42	_Alice_	don't
2014-05-01 13:39:50	mathuin	I actually paid for Crossover to get Fallout 3 to work, and it didn't.  Meh.
2014-05-01 13:39:54	_Alice_	Mirror's EDge does
2014-05-01 13:39:56	_Alice_	Edge
2014-05-01 13:40:02	salvatoz	the downside to wine is it's a compatibility layer and not an emulator/vm so its support is inconsistent
2014-05-01 13:40:13	jnoah	want tea? get http://www.teavana.com/the-teas/green-teas/p/jasmine-dragon-phoenix-pearls-green-tea
2014-05-01 13:40:19	_Alice_	also Blacklight is like less than a FPS
2014-05-01 13:40:19	jnoah	/end random thought
2014-05-01 13:40:58	Odysimus	jnoah: I just go to the tea shop downtown, which remindes me I'm running low
2014-05-01 13:41:03	_Alice_	so i have little faith with wine working
2014-05-01 13:41:14	rordway	_Alice_: I tried Blacklight on the PS4, the bot AI was hilarious
2014-05-01 13:41:24	salvatoz	ugh. I don't even know what I want to do. why can't computers just magically run every program I want without any issues?
2014-05-01 13:41:29	_Alice_	i play Blacklight: Retribution
2014-05-01 13:41:46	_Alice_	and i don't play with bots..
2014-05-01 13:41:47	_Alice_	they suck
2014-05-01 13:41:51	jnoah	Odysimus: i have yet to go there, i've heard nothing but good things though
2014-05-01 13:41:55	rordway	they just ran in a straight line at you, usually getting hung up on boxes or whatever else was in the way
2014-05-01 13:41:55	drkitty	salvatoz: Writing software is hard.
2014-05-01 13:42:05	mathuin	The tea shop downtown is actually pretty awesome.
2014-05-01 13:42:08	salvatoz	drkitty: no it's not, what are you talking about?
2014-05-01 13:42:08	Alan_S	playonlinux helps alot
2014-05-01 13:42:12	drkitty	lol
2014-05-01 13:42:14	_Alice_	yea so you use the bar and head shot them since you don't need to lead
2014-05-01 13:42:25	jnoah	Alan_S: a lot*
2014-05-01 13:42:31	_Alice_	i love the amr
2014-05-01 13:42:33	_Alice_	best gun
2014-05-01 13:42:38	_Alice_	(actually it's a shittty gun)
2014-05-01 13:42:49	Alan_S	I would take a look at winehq and see what it says about the games you want to run
2014-05-01 13:43:00	_Alice_	^
2014-05-01 13:43:11	_Alice_	and then try it and have it not work
2014-05-01 13:43:19	_Alice_	because the site is not accurate like
2014-05-01 13:43:36	_Alice_	at all
2014-05-01 13:44:13	_Alice_	>.<;;
2014-05-01 13:44:51	edunham	try it, have it break, file a bug, get sick of waiting for someone else to fix it, fix it yourself, be hailed as awesome forever and ever
2014-05-01 13:45:06	_Alice_	unfortunately
2014-05-01 13:45:15	_Alice_	i don't give enough shts
2014-05-01 13:45:20	_Alice_	to fix wine stuff
2014-05-01 13:45:23	salvatoz	well, the other thing is I already have a bunch of games installed under windows so optimally I would rather just keep doing what I've been doing
2014-05-01 13:45:34	salvatoz	although wine would at least let me run those games under linux
2014-05-01 13:45:41	Alan_S	I find it is ok you need to look at that bugs people are having and on what hardware/distro to get a good idea
2014-05-01 13:46:14	_Alice_	to complicated.. i'd rather justrun windows games in windows
2014-05-01 13:47:12	Alan_S	have you gotten a 2nd pair of eyes on the virtualbox crash see if that can be debuged?
2014-05-01 13:47:16	edunham	yeah, and if you don't object to acquiring a copy of Windows, that's the most straightforward solution
2014-05-01 13:47:48	salvatoz	I've looked into it and it appears to be an issue that's been known and undiagnosed for about four years now
2014-05-01 13:48:02	rordway	salvatoz: have you tried other VM options on Windows?
2014-05-01 13:48:03	edunham	wow... help 'em diagnose it?
2014-05-01 13:48:30	_Alice_	You can always install Windows for like a few days
2014-05-01 13:48:34	_Alice_	play a game
2014-05-01 13:48:35	_Alice_	shred drive
2014-05-01 13:48:47	salvatoz	rordway: my original question was whether anyone knows of alternatives to virtualbox
2014-05-01 13:48:57	bryon	vmware
2014-05-01 13:49:14	bryon	you can get free if you're a student
2014-05-01 13:49:21	bryon	...legitimately
2014-05-01 13:49:25	jordane	qemu, vmware, kvm/xen + openstack, ganeti, libvirt, etc.
2014-05-01 13:49:29	edunham	personally i find that my motivation to play a game is all gone by the time i've sat through an OS install... then again i have a short attention span
2014-05-01 13:49:52	_Alice_	it takes like.. a few hours to setup Windows
2014-05-01 13:50:00	rordway	salvatoz: try vmware
2014-05-01 13:50:00	bryon	edunham: LOOK! SOMETHING SHINY! ----->
2014-05-01 13:50:18	Alan_S	jordane: for a windows host
2014-05-01 13:50:21	_Alice_	and most Linux distros are like less than an hour
2014-05-01 13:50:23	salvatoz	rordway: I'd rather not if it's possible
2014-05-01 13:50:41	mathuin	OS installs are like baking projects:  they need a lot of attention at the start, and then the occasional check-in.  If the toothpick comes out of the USB slot clean, it's done!
2014-05-01 13:50:49	jordane	Alan_S: oh, for a windows host? Lame.
2014-05-01 13:50:52	_Alice_	i think i will get a smoothie to keep me from passing out on my way to the bank

2014-05-01 13:51:24	mathuin	My trusty install took me eighteen hours btw.
2014-05-01 13:51:26	_Alice_	MILLION
2014-05-01 13:51:32	edunham	it's less worse than yesterday though
2014-05-01 13:51:33	mathuin	All because they broke fakeraid support. :-(
2014-05-01 13:52:03	_Alice_	i need to get an AC
2014-05-01 13:52:32	_Alice_	but i'm only here for like 7 more weeks maybe 6
2014-05-01 13:53:15	salvatoz	rordway: Well, I don't have to play games with WINE. I have two SSD's in my machine so in the "worst case scenario" I'm just running mint on one and windows on the other. I'm just trying to maximize convenience (i.e. ability to alternate between work and gaming without a reboot) here
2014-05-01 13:53:45	salvatoz	rordway: also, I can get vmware workstation through the university but that's strictly non-commercial so I couldn't do my job with it, making it a no go

2014-05-01 13:54:09	salvatoz	I have a shared 1TB data drive
2014-05-01 13:54:11	_Alice_	i don't have a lot of games and i use mroe than 500GB
2014-05-01 13:54:14	_Alice_	oh ok
2014-05-01 13:54:19	salvatoz	plus room to expand if needed
2014-05-01 13:54:43	 *	jordane runs windows on a 60gb partitions
2014-05-01 13:54:49	jordane	most games I play are small though.

2014-05-01 13:55:03	fridgei	yeah steam is like a huge hard drive for me
2014-05-01 13:55:10	fridgei	i just erase games when im done and download them later
2014-05-01 13:55:11	mathuin	steam ftw

2014-05-01 13:55:23	rordway	your Internet provider hates you
2014-05-01 13:55:23	_Alice_	windows games asre 5 - 14GB
2014-05-01 13:55:26	mathuin	except right now, where steam is horrible and won't send me steam guard emails anymore.
2014-05-01 13:55:30	fridgei	so install 2-3 games
2014-05-01 13:55:32	_Alice_	my games are generally around 6 to 10
2014-05-01 13:55:34	jordane	_Alice_: maybe the ones you play are.
2014-05-01 13:55:35	fridgei	then erase them
2014-05-01 13:55:37	fridgei	then install them again
2014-05-01 13:55:44	fridgei	it takes no time to download a game
2014-05-01 13:55:46	_Alice_	fridgei: haha
2014-05-01 13:55:46	salvatoz	basically I have an obvious solution in front of me (just give up on ever getting this thing working as a hackintosh and install mint instead of mavericks), but I don't want to do that if I can avoid it since I'd rather hold onto the dream and be able to work under windows
2014-05-01 13:55:57	_Alice_	hackintosh??
2014-05-01 13:55:58	edunham	yeah yeah and pdx is getting google fiber
2014-05-01 13:56:00	_Alice_	lol
2014-05-01 13:56:03	edunham	i know you have real internet up there
2014-05-01 13:56:03	fridgei	that too

2014-05-01 13:56:56	_Alice_	idk
2014-05-01 13:57:00	_Alice_	corvallis is backwater

2014-05-01 14:39:09	jordane	that reminds me of a diff eq professor I knew. She taught systems of differential equations, and introduced and glossed over significant linear algebra topics in 20 minutes or less.
2014-05-01 14:39:37	jordane	She once taught an entire topic of linear algebra in half an hour. I had taken a linear algebra class devoted solely to said topic
2014-05-01 14:43:27	bryon	wow
2014-05-01 14:44:56	jordane	Yeah. It wasn't a pre-req or anything either

2014-05-01 15:16:21	chekkaa	start
2014-05-01 15:16:23	akeym	+m is good when you need to make a channel announcement and everybody's talking - or the current conversation has gone out of control
2014-05-01 15:16:25	Ac-town	edunham: do you want to manually +v everyone?
2014-05-01 15:16:35	Ac-town	or make it harder for guests/visitors to talk?
2014-05-01 15:16:36	akeym	you can auto +v
2014-05-01 15:16:43	edunham	ah, yeah, i think we were planning on hamper +v-ing, or auto
2014-05-01 15:16:43	Ac-town	then its the same as +q
2014-05-01 15:16:48	edunham	yeah exactly
2014-05-01 15:16:54	edunham	they don't seem substantially differnt
2014-05-01 15:17:02	mathuin	Is nick registration required for this channel?
2014-05-01 15:17:05	bryon	well, it seems like +q is difficult to implement
2014-05-01 15:17:05	Ac-town	and at that point just use q
2014-05-01 15:17:12	akeym	no
2014-05-01 15:17:21	akeym	mathuin: ^
2014-05-01 15:17:33	edunham	mathuin: it's required for admin channel but not for here
2014-05-01 15:17:35	mathuin	*nod*  So in theory someone could dodge a ban?
2014-05-01 15:17:53	bryon	well sure
2014-05-01 15:17:59	edunham	sure, but that's kinda inevitable if we want to let newbies in
2014-05-01 15:18:02	akeym	well, if they really wanted to, yes, but we could also enable that flag temporarily
2014-05-01 15:18:11	chekkaa	but if it's obvious that they're bypassing, they could just be banned again
2014-05-01 15:18:25	chekkaa	and if it's not obvious, then they're not causing any trouble
2014-05-01 15:18:26	mathuin	I think that within three sends, we'd be able to identify the typical sender anyway.
2014-05-01 15:19:12	Ac-town	using quiet with chanserv is supereasy
2014-05-01 15:19:30	Ac-town	and people will get around bans if they really want to
2014-05-01 15:19:42	Ac-town	but then you just ban them again and again
2014-05-01 15:20:58	edunham	and if we just ban whoever misbehaves
2014-05-01 15:21:13	edunham	then if someone banned from one account comes back with another and doesn't violate any policies
2014-05-01 15:21:17	edunham	then is it actually a problem?
2014-05-01 15:21:38	Ac-town	you set a rule
2014-05-01 15:21:43	Ac-town	ban evasion is bannable
2014-05-01 15:22:11	edunham	that sounds... comically futile
2014-05-01 15:22:21	Ac-town	if someone comes in and is banned and then comes back a few days later with a different name and doesn't break any rules
2014-05-01 15:22:26	mathuin	Some folks *like* playing whack a mole.
2014-05-01 15:22:32	Ac-town	and is hard to figure out who it is, then who cares
2014-05-01 15:22:44	Ac-town	but if they say "lol yeah I was x who broke rule y"
2014-05-01 15:22:47	edunham	Ac-town: yeah i prefer "accounts which break rules get banned"
2014-05-01 15:22:48	Ac-town	then banned
2014-05-01 15:23:27	jordane	hamper: will edunham become a tyrannical banhammer-wielding maniac?
2014-05-01 15:23:28	@hamper	jordane: No. No, I don't think so.
2014-05-01 15:23:33	mathuin	Awww.
2014-05-01 15:23:33	kennric	if banning is trivial to circumvent, it has no disincentive value
2014-05-01 15:23:52	Ac-town	every method is easy to get around in irc
2014-05-01 15:24:02	Ac-town	you just have to keep banning till they give up
2014-05-01 15:24:17	edunham	banning takes away your old name, identity, and reputation if you come back
2014-05-01 15:24:17	kennric	as wil all moderation, the one and only solution is for someone to be paying attention consistently
2014-05-01 15:24:36	Ac-town	which is why most people have logs
2014-05-01 15:24:40	Ac-town	and usually lurk
2014-05-01 15:24:52	edunham	actually we could set hamper to ban on certain inevitably hostile/against-policy phrases
2014-05-01 15:25:01	edunham	though that's a heck of a rabbit hole
2014-05-01 15:25:06	kennric	whatever the mechanics - but a clear policy is important, if the policy says, in effect "we'll ban you but not do anythign if you circumvent", that's not very useful
2014-05-01 15:25:08	Ac-town	usually thats just kick
2014-05-01 15:25:19	Ac-town	kennric: you dont state that
2014-05-01 15:25:32	Ac-town	you just state that people who get around the ban will be banned
2014-05-01 15:25:36	kennric	Ac-town: you may say it implictely without intending to
2014-05-01 15:25:58	kennric	yes, and then you pay attention and actually do that whenever you can
2014-05-01 15:26:04	edunham	tbh I still prefer "any account which violates the rules will get warned then banned"
2014-05-01 15:26:12	edunham	and rules set up so that bragging about ban evasion is bad
2014-05-01 15:26:26	Ac-town	thats usually how it works
2014-05-01 15:26:37	edunham	like... perhaps I'm far too lenient, but the prospect of having a second chance for as long as behavior remains good seems fair and reasonable to me
2014-05-01 15:26:45	kennric	"enforcement is the true description of any policy"
2014-05-01 15:26:52	edunham	kennric++
2014-05-01 15:27:01	Ac-town	a warning/short ban is always a good first step
2014-05-01 15:27:22	mathuin	Finding the freenode policy was good.  Are there any channels with existing policies that might be worth emulating?
2014-05-01 15:27:26	edunham	but yeah, hamper kick on lines containing racist/religion-ist/otherwise/against-TOS words without negation might be sort of neat
2014-05-01 15:27:42	fridgei	thats hard to parse
2014-05-01 15:27:51	jordane	mathuin: http://freenode.net/policy.shtml
2014-05-01 15:28:01	Ac-town	if its just a kick then its okay
2014-05-01 15:28:11	kennric	teach hamper to analyze the last few lines of text by anyone who gets banned, and learn the kinds of speech that get banned automatically
2014-05-01 15:28:18	mathuin	jordane: that's what was referenced earlier, I was asking about channel-specific policies.
2014-05-01 15:28:32	fridgei	i think once you are using NLP to ban based on being insenstive
2014-05-01 15:28:34	jordane	mathuin: Ah. Those are typically left to the channel.
2014-05-01 15:28:35	bryon	i still like the idea of automagically applying +q for x amount of time when hamper sees a word on the badwords list
2014-05-01 15:28:38	fridgei	it would b eless work to just ban people for being a dick
2014-05-01 15:28:50	mathuin	jordane: which is why I wondered if other channels might have policies that might be worth emulating. :-)
2014-05-01 15:28:57	spectralsun	/ignore    <-- it does wonders
2014-05-01 15:28:59	bryon	fridgei: incorporate Wheaton's Law into the LUG's rules
2014-05-01 15:29:05	fridgei	yeah its easy
2014-05-01 15:29:11	edunham	fridgei: i don't think nlp should ban, but it could kick
2014-05-01 15:29:21	edunham	bryon: remind me again what wheaton's law is?
2014-05-01 15:29:21	spectralsun	you all are aware you can /ignore
2014-05-01 15:29:26	mathuin	"don't be a dick"
2014-05-01 15:29:28	bryon	edunham: don't be a dick
2014-05-01 15:29:32	edunham	ah
2014-05-01 15:29:42	edunham	spectralsun: but that doesn't fix the atmosphere for newbies or others without it
2014-05-01 15:29:44	fridgei	its a rule i live by except for when i dont
2014-05-01 15:29:49	Ac-town	spectralsun: sometimes you need to enforce rules for the greater good though
2014-05-01 15:30:11	mathuin	spectralsun: also, private ignore is total fail in text-based chat systems.  it only works if _everyone_ ignores and fails to respond.
2014-05-01 15:30:15	spectralsun	V_V
2014-05-01 15:30:16	@hamper	uhoh
2014-05-01 15:30:17	spectralsun	!voteban
2014-05-01 15:30:25	fridgei	yes
2014-05-01 15:30:33	fridgei	mob rule ftw
2014-05-01 15:30:39	spectralsun	works great on cs:s
2014-05-01 15:30:46	Ac-town	sometimes
2014-05-01 15:30:54	Ac-town	voteban would be fun
2014-05-01 15:31:09	spectralsun	should be temporary, of course
2014-05-01 15:31:10	mathuin	I personally find seeing half a conversation more annoying than a whole one.
2014-05-01 15:31:13	spectralsun	but each time maybe it gets a little longer
2014-05-01 15:31:17	spectralsun	so the sting is worse
2014-05-01 15:31:22	spectralsun	until you get not to piss everyone off
2014-05-01 15:31:25	bryon	i disagree on the voteban issue
2014-05-01 15:31:45	fridgei	i think it wouldnt really end up banning anybody
2014-05-01 15:31:56	Ac-town	we rarely if at all need to use ban
2014-05-01 15:31:59	edunham	ehh, voteban could be misused
2014-05-01 15:32:02	spectralsun	yeah, even a vote getting iniated
2014-05-01 15:32:04	fridgei	it could be funny
2014-05-01 15:32:08	spectralsun	not i would need > 95% majority
2014-05-01 15:32:11	edunham	and would likely be used in "humor" in a way that could be misunderstood or discriminatory
2014-05-01 15:32:13	spectralsun	if a vote gets initiated
2014-05-01 15:32:17	spectralsun	and people are voting
2014-05-01 15:32:22	spectralsun	just that does something ^
2014-05-01 15:32:29	bryon	edunham clearly understands my reasoning. =]
2014-05-01 15:32:30	fridgei	you could just us beatings at lug meetings
2014-05-01 15:32:32	spectralsun	it*
2014-05-01 15:32:38	fridgei	use*
2014-05-01 15:32:54	edunham	fridgei: uhh not without consent i couldn't... and with, it's no longer meeting-appropriate
2014-05-01 15:32:59	Ac-town	edunham: why not just this, spam bans can be given by admins at anytime
2014-05-01 15:33:00	edunham	OSU rules, and all
2014-05-01 15:33:05	fridgei	hmm
2014-05-01 15:33:06	mathuin	edunham: thank you for saying that, I was trying to find a good way to say that.
2014-05-01 15:33:08	Ac-town	but real bans have via vote irl
2014-05-01 15:33:11	Ac-town	at a meeting
2014-05-01 15:33:12	fridgei	off campus montly beating meetings
2014-05-01 15:33:26	spectralsun	:o
2014-05-01 15:33:39	edunham	fridgei: this is rapidly becoming topics suitable for different channels
2014-05-01 15:33:47	Ac-town	s/have/happen/
2014-05-01 15:33:47	@hamper	Ac-town actually meant: but real bans happen via vote irl
2014-05-01 15:33:47	fridgei	probably
2014-05-01 15:33:50	edunham	ie not this one :P
2014-05-01 15:34:06	muricula	I vote we ban fridgei for advocating topics contrary to OSU policy
2014-05-01 15:34:16	 *	muricula fools around...
2014-05-01 15:34:28	edunham	actually though we should talk about this stuff at a meeting
2014-05-01 15:34:33	churchjo	!voteban fridgei
2014-05-01 15:34:35	edunham	probably next week's, since no talk scheduled
2014-05-01 15:34:38	fridgei	!voteban fridgei
2014-05-01 15:34:42	fridgei	that guys a dick
2014-05-01 15:34:53	edunham	!voteban fridgei for saying mean things about people
2014-05-01 15:35:00	Ac-town	!voteban hamper
2014-05-01 15:35:01	churchjo	I concur
2014-05-01 15:35:09	edunham	hamper: should we ban you?
2014-05-01 15:35:09	@hamper	edunham: I think... Yes.
2014-05-01 15:35:12	edunham	aww :(
2014-05-01 15:35:17	bryon	it'd be funny if a !voteban got a majority vote and it banned whoever initiated the !voteban
2014-05-01 15:35:18	mathuin	The only way to win is not to play.
2014-05-01 15:35:31	kennric	you know it's bad when even the bot gives up
2014-05-01 15:35:36	edunham	yeeeah
2014-05-01 15:35:38	bryon	s/way to win/winning move/
2014-05-01 15:35:38	@hamper	mathuin actually meant: The only winning move is not to play.
2014-05-01 15:35:39	jordane	hamper: should we ban you and bring back manatee?
2014-05-01 15:35:39	@hamper	all hail the seacow!
2014-05-01 15:35:42	jnoah	***chair rave in a room full of coworkers like you just don't care***
2014-05-01 15:35:48	mathuin	oooOOOOOOoooooh
2014-05-01 15:35:55	churchjo	damn, I would get banned
2014-05-01 15:35:55	edunham	jnoah: just don't do that in the chair that falls over
2014-05-01 15:35:59	bryon	ZOINKS!  A GHOST!
2014-05-01 15:36:05	jnoah	edunham: haha, good point
2014-05-01 15:36:06	edunham	(it's currently at xray, so you're probably safe)
2014-05-01 15:36:08	churchjo	I repeal my !voteban against fridgei
2014-05-01 15:36:16	edunham	!voteunban fridgei
2014-05-01 15:36:27	fridgei	!voterebanfridgei
2014-05-01 15:36:31	fridgei	with a space
2014-05-01 15:36:45	edunham	fridgei: no, you're so offensive you get your own hamper plugin for bannign you :P
2014-05-01 15:36:52	fridgei	true
2014-05-01 15:37:12	bryon	!banfridgei
2014-05-01 15:39:03	mathuin	On lily for a while people made plugins to address particular annoyances from particular users.  There was one called bmw.pl for a guy (named bmw, duh) who always put a space at the beginning of his sends.  Eventually someone's feelings got hurt when a plugin was named after them, and they cleaned it all up, but for a while it was kinda funny.
2014-05-01 15:39:48	muricula	what was lily?
2014-05-01 15:40:03	muricula	what would the mathuin plugin do I wonder?
2014-05-01 15:40:54	mathuin	http://lily.acm.rpi.edu:7780/  And there never was a plugin for me. :-)
2014-05-01 15:42:02	edunham	hmm... what say we just give hamper a !kickme and a !banme
2014-05-01 15:42:14	edunham	and !banme bans you for 2^(times you've invoked it) minutes
2014-05-01 15:42:40	edunham	for those who desire kicks or bans when ops won't oblige
2014-05-01 15:42:44	edunham	(or are just lazy)
2014-05-01 15:43:06	fridgei	exponential bans would be fun
2014-05-01 15:45:43	--	Mode #osu-lug [+q $r:_Alice_!*@*] by ChanServ
2014-05-01 15:46:21	Weyoun	Hmmm.... Not sure that works
2014-05-01 15:47:01	edunham	Weyoun: your syntax is bad...
2014-05-01 15:47:12	Ac-town	nick!user@host
2014-05-01 15:47:15	--	Mode #osu-lug [-q $r:_Alice_!*@*] by ChanServ
2014-05-01 15:47:20	Weyoun	No, it works.
2014-05-01 15:47:30	akeym	can you use $r on q?
2014-05-01 15:47:35	akeym	i thought that was only b
2014-05-01 15:47:35	Weyoun	It is what is called an extended "ban"
2014-05-01 15:47:36	edunham	doesn't look like
2014-05-01 15:47:37	Weyoun	Apparently so.
2014-05-01 15:47:44	Weyoun	But don’t set it through ChanServ.
2014-05-01 15:47:51	edunham	aaand chanserv is being reluctant to -q
2014-05-01 15:48:16	testuser11	try to +q me
2014-05-01 15:48:16	Weyoun	I think ChanServ may just be oblivious to extbans, so it will think $r:_Alice_ is just another nickname.
2014-05-01 15:48:31	Weyoun	testuser11: We are trying out an extban instead of a regular one.
2014-05-01 15:48:39	edunham	oddly enough it's refusing to un-q the $r
2014-05-01 15:48:53	Weyoun	It already did
2014-05-01 15:48:59	Weyoun	edunham: Try coming to my pizza channel
2014-05-01 15:49:01	akeym	15:47 -!- mode/#osu-lug [-q $r:_Alice_!*@*] by ChanServ
2014-05-01 15:49:02	edunham	oh, didn't even see that :D
2014-05-01 15:49:08	edunham	yeah i saw that when i looked
2014-05-01 15:49:09	edunham	DERP
2014-05-01 15:49:14	edunham	chanserv didn't ack it, is all
2014-05-01 15:49:18	edunham	like in our pm
2014-05-01 15:49:29	edunham	we really should figure out lug policy on all this before doing it anyways
2014-05-01 15:49:30	akeym	yeah, it doesn't seem to ack quiets
2014-05-01 15:49:44	edunham	well i think it acked the +q but not the -q
2014-05-01 15:50:00	Weyoun	akeym: I think it is just that ChanServ just thinks $r:username is just another nick, so it appended !*@* to it.
2014-05-01 15:50:10	Weyoun	Which is what we do not want.
2014-05-01 15:50:24	Weyoun	But anyhow...
2014-05-01 15:50:39	Weyoun	+q is supposed to allow them into the room, but mutes them, right?
2014-05-01 15:51:11	akeym	essentially, yes
2014-05-01 15:51:23	edunham	as i understand, +q lets you join part and listen, but does not relay anything you type to others.
2014-05-01 15:51:24	Weyoun	edunham: Can you come into #osu-lug-pizza so I can test this?
2014-05-01 15:52:13	edunham	Server: #osu-lug-pizza Cannot send to channel
2014-05-01 15:52:19	edunham	after you quieted me
2014-05-01 15:52:29	Weyoun	Ok
2014-05-01 15:52:37	Weyoun	So it is $a:nick
2014-05-01 15:53:25	Weyoun	And so if you want to +q someone based on their account, use /mode #channel +q $a:acctname
2014-05-01 15:53:30	Weyoun	But don’t do it through ChanServ.
2014-05-01 15:53:33	akeym	http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml
2014-05-01 15:55:13	<--	testuser11 (8cd3a788@gateway/web/freenode/ip.140.211.167.136) has quit (Quit: Page closed)
2014-05-01 15:59:53	chance	edunham: i feel like we should probably make a lug chanserv account
2014-05-01 16:00:05	chance	one with ownership/admin perms
2014-05-01 16:00:20	chance	just cause people graduate and stuff
2014-05-01 16:00:24	edunham	err, chanserv account? you mean nickserv?
2014-05-01 16:00:29	chance	err yeah
2014-05-01 16:00:33	edunham	also we've never had a problem before with just handing the +F along
2014-05-01 16:00:40	chance	i know, but it would make it trivial
2014-05-01 16:00:59	Weyoun	You mean setting +r here?
2014-05-01 16:01:02	edunham	I'm worried about the potential for abuse if the password gets leaked, or of losing the password if it's not well-documented
2014-05-01 16:01:04	chance	you could still give ops to people normally
2014-05-01 16:01:12	chance	thats valid
2014-05-01 16:01:24	chance	but the abuse could happen if *anyones* password gets leaked
2014-05-01 16:01:26	chance	who has ops
2014-05-01 16:01:28	edunham	it's true
2014-05-01 16:01:36	chance	the losing the pw thing is true
2014-05-01 16:01:38	edunham	however, i'm talking specifically about the handoff of such an account
2014-05-01 16:01:53	edunham	I think it would be harder to hand over an admin account than just +F the new leadership
2014-05-01 16:02:17	edunham	the only things which would make it easier, like having the pw written down somewhere, would move rather than solving the fundamental issue
2014-05-01 16:03:00	mythmon	chance: what would you prefer, multiple users with sudo, or everyone logging in as root?
2014-05-01 16:03:19	Weyoun	Doesn’t services here have a successor feature?
2014-05-01 16:03:27	edunham	Weyoun: yep
2014-05-01 16:03:39	Weyoun	On Insomnia, you can set a successor (or even set founder) of a channel through ChanServ.
2014-05-01 16:03:53	edunham	chance: additionally, it'd be unclear which officer had taken a given action if they hid behind an admin account, which could cause issues
2014-05-01 16:03:54	Weyoun	Speaking of which.... You fell out of Insomnia
2014-05-01 16:04:03	chance	mythmon: well sudo, however there are plenty of places *cough* which do the latter
2014-05-01 16:04:10	akeym	edunham: excellent point :)
2014-05-01 16:04:27	edunham	oh also revoking access from old folks would be harder
2014-05-01 16:04:32	mythmon	chance: right. having one founer account is like every logging in with sudo. it's not as secure.
2014-05-01 16:04:54	chance	yup
2014-05-01 16:04:55	edunham	s/with sudo/as root/
2014-05-01 16:04:55	mythmon	Weyoun: you can set founder via chanserv here too. not sure about succesor, but i think so.
2014-05-01 16:04:55	@hamper	mythmon actually meant: chance: right. having one founer account is like every logging in as root. it's not as secure.
2014-05-01 16:04:56	chance	its valid
2014-05-01 16:06:07	Weyoun	Though successor is only if the founder’s nick is deregistered.
2014-05-01 16:06:40	edunham	so yeah... although it's totally an idea that would solve the problem, I think the other idea solves a handful of related problems better.
2014-05-01 16:06:40	Weyoun	edunham: You and a whole bunch of others dropped from Insomnia when onid restarted. You coming back?
2014-05-01 16:06:48	edunham	uhh, i wasn't in any channels
2014-05-01 16:07:06	Weyoun	IIRC, you were in #chat, and the backup channel at the time.
2014-05-01 16:07:41	edunham	oh
2014-05-01 16:07:49	edunham	yeah well chat is just hat simulator and innuendo land
2014-05-01 16:10:34	rordway	hat simulator?
2014-05-01 16:11:30	edunham	tf2
2014-05-01 16:11:43	rordway	aha
2014-05-01 16:12:16	rordway	people still play that?
2014-05-01 16:12:51	Ac-town	I do sometimes
2014-05-01 16:12:55	Ac-town	still fun
2014-05-01 16:13:37	bkero	<3 tf2
2014-05-01 16:14:35	Alan_S	such a good lan game

2014-05-02 10:36:31	bkero	So now you just put the area you want to cache into view, then press the search bar, minimize the keyboard by pressing 'back', scroll to the bottom, and there should be a listing that says 'make selected area available offline'

2014-05-02 10:37:17	pwnguin	does maps actually use tiles?

2014-05-02 10:38:08	edunham	couldn't one give it like a 32GB sdcard and tell it to cache to there?

2014-05-02 10:39:01	edunham	can cyanogen lie to it and claim the card was where it wanted to be all along?
2014-05-02 10:39:09	mythmon	heh
2014-05-02 10:39:10	lrr	not really
2014-05-02 10:39:21	relud	it would be awesome if you could give maps 32GB and ask it to cache your state, with businesses and turn-by-turn navigation.
2014-05-02 10:39:23	lrr	the whole sdcard in android thing right now is very hotly contested
2014-05-02 10:39:23	bkero	You can totally symlink that crap though
2014-05-02 10:39:38	mythmon	but I don't think it is a matter of space limits.
2014-05-02 10:39:42	lrr	^^
2014-05-02 10:39:43	mythmon	I think maps just has a limit to what it will cache.
2014-05-02 10:39:49	bkero	It might do weird things if you (umount to) mount as a mass storage device
2014-05-02 10:39:59	edunham	mythmon: that's pretty annoying.

2014-05-02 10:49:21	mythmon	edunham: blame jnoah.
2014-05-02 10:49:54	mythmon	if we really want to keep all the old data, we could have something like an initial karma that adds or subtracts the appropriate value from a user the moment we did the wipe.
2014-05-02 10:50:09	mythmon	so there would be this massive spike in karma, and then back to +/- 1
2014-05-02 10:50:13	spectralsun	yeah I don't see how you can't migrate
2014-05-02 10:50:16	spectralsun	write a script
2014-05-02 10:50:26	spectralsun	unless you're recording who says what

2014-05-02 16:22:46	spectralsun	Most civilized people are out of touch with reality, because they confuse the world as it is, with the world as they think about it, talk about it and describe it. For on the one hand there is the real world and on the other the an old system of symbols about that world, which we have in our minds. These are very, very useful symbols -- all civilizations depends on them. But like all things, they have their
2014-05-02 16:22:49	spectralsun	disadvantages. And the principal disadvantage of symbols is that we confuse them with reality. Just as we confuse money with actual wealth, and our names about ourselves, our ideas about ourselves, our images of ourselfve..with ourselves.

2014-05-02 16:25:07	ysnI	Most likely, and nope, no Battlestar Galactica
2014-05-02 16:25:15	Weyoun	Because that is all I can think of when I see that initialism.
2014-05-02 16:25:24	ysnI	although I have watched that during lunch here before, making for some rather meta acronymns

2014-05-04 00:55:47	chekkaa	what do you guys use for python development? right now I am setting up vim with a few plugins to make things easier, but there also exists a python plugin for eclipse
2014-05-04 00:56:14	chekkaa	I'm wondering if that would be easier than trying to recreate all the features in vim through many different plugins
2014-05-04 00:56:27	mythmon	chekkaa: my approach is to not try and recreate eclipse's features.
2014-05-04 00:56:30	mythmon	also, to use Sublime.
2014-05-04 00:57:25	chekkaa	does sublime have ide features built in, or so I still have to cobble together my own ide?
2014-05-04 00:57:40	mythmon	why are those the only options?
2014-05-04 00:57:47	mythmon	also, I don't know what you mean by "ide features"
2014-05-04 00:58:18	chekkaa	syntax highlighting, error highlighting, refactoring tools, etc.
2014-05-04 00:58:41	mythmon	syntax highlighting is built in and on by default.
2014-05-04 00:58:54	chekkaa	code completion too
2014-05-04 00:59:15	mythmon	if by "error highlighting" you mean linting, there are pretty good plugins for python and JS.
2014-05-04 00:59:19	chekkaa	so far I have code completion, syntax highlighting, and partial error detection in vim
2014-05-04 00:59:22	mythmon	probably other things too, but I don't know those.
2014-05-04 00:59:45	chekkaa	idk what linting is, but I mean being able to detect using a nonexistent variable or something
2014-05-04 00:59:51	chekkaa	or typos
2014-05-04 00:59:56	mythmon	sublime has code word completion for anything in the file, and there is a plugin for Intellisomethingorother that tries to understand python imports and things.
2014-05-04 00:59:58	mythmon	i don't use it.
2014-05-04 01:00:24	mythmon	I have flake8 integration, which is style and things like bad variable names.
2014-05-04 01:00:39	mythmon	in particular, it is pep8 and pyflakes in one.
2014-05-04 01:01:05	mythmon	also, the ui is much better :3
2014-05-04 01:01:13	mythmon	(than either vim or eclipsE)
2014-05-04 01:01:59	mythmon	refactoring: I've found that text editing features like multiple cursors and really fast find-in-all-files gets me everything i want out of refactoring tools.
2014-05-04 01:02:36	chekkaa	what about things like being able to rename variables
2014-05-04 01:02:44	chekkaa	or extracting functions?
2014-05-04 01:03:36	mythmon	that first one is just text editing. no smarts required.
2014-05-04 01:03:46	mythmon	i argue that second one is not useful as a blind tool.
2014-05-04 01:03:46	chekkaa	mythmon: pls explain
2014-05-04 01:04:03	mythmon	and that doing it with thought is no faster in an ide than in an editor.
2014-05-04 01:04:35	mythmon	when i want to change a variable name, i put my cursor on it, press ctrl+d to select other occurences, then caw
2014-05-04 01:04:39	chekkaa	how do I rename my "i" variable in the whole file without manually going through with s/i/derp/gc?
2014-05-04 01:05:08	mythmon	either use better regexes, or use tools that know how to select names instead of characters.
2014-05-04 01:05:10	mythmon	like ctrl+d
2014-05-04 01:06:36	chekkaa	ctrl+d?
2014-05-04 01:07:14	mythmon	sublime feature
2014-05-04 01:07:15	chekkaa	oh, derp
2014-05-04 01:07:32	mythmon	here, let me show you renaming a variable in my workflow
2014-05-04 01:08:10	mythmon	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5795783/screenshot-20140504-30454.ogv
2014-05-04 01:09:21	chekkaa	and that doesn't screw up if you have a function called "herpnamederp?
2014-05-04 01:09:31	mythmon	nope
2014-05-04 01:09:45	mythmon	because sublime has sane defaults for what an identifier is.
2014-05-04 01:09:48	chekkaa	so it does know context for variables?
2014-05-04 01:09:49	chekkaa	ok
2014-05-04 01:09:53	mythmon	by default, it is something like \<name\>
2014-05-04 01:09:55	chekkaa	that's what I was asking for
2014-05-04 01:10:09	mythmon	now, if you just blindly hammer the key, it will keep going into other functions
2014-05-04 01:10:13	mythmon	it doesn't understand python.
2014-05-04 01:10:25	mythmon	so you have to use it smartly. but you can exclude instances.
2014-05-04 01:10:30	chekkaa	hm
2014-05-04 01:11:42	mythmon	for example: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5795783/screenshot-20140504-31882.ogv
2014-05-04 01:12:14	mythmon	i wish i could easily show key presses in those videos.
2014-05-04 01:12:36	chekkaa	that's still pretty cool though
2014-05-04 01:12:44	chekkaa	what program are you using for those?
2014-05-04 01:13:09	mythmon	a cobbling together of recordmydesktop, dropbox, some random C file I found on the internet, a bash file, and some magic.
2014-05-04 01:13:14	chekkaa	also, that doesn't seem too much better than just s/name/newname/gc
2014-05-04 01:13:19	chekkaa	lol
2014-05-04 01:13:25	mythmon	i find it a little easier.
2014-05-04 01:13:36	mythmon	because I don't have to deal with typing out a good regex.
2014-05-04 01:13:40	mythmon	i use that feature a lot.
2014-05-04 01:13:54	mythmon	for example, let me show you something I did today when I was writing tests.
2014-05-04 01:13:56	chekkaa	better, but not equal to what a real ide offers
2014-05-04 01:14:33	-->	hoangt (hoangt@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu) has joined #osu-lug
2014-05-04 01:15:42	mythmon	because it isn't a *language* feature, I can use it for other editing tasks: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5795783/screenshot-20140504-377.ogv
2014-05-04 01:16:20	mythmon	it's just a way i can edit txt.
2014-05-04 01:16:21	mythmon	*text
2014-05-04 01:16:30	mythmon	so I can do it on a smaller scale than "all instances of this variable."
2014-05-04 01:16:37	mythmon	or on a larger scale
2014-05-04 01:17:24	chekkaa	well, that's also doable with a vbeforehand
2014-05-04 01:17:36	mythmon	vbeforehand?
2014-05-04 01:17:40	chekkaa	v beforehand
2014-05-04 01:17:44	chekkaa	v in vim
2014-05-04 01:18:01	mythmon	i don't follow.
2014-05-04 01:18:07	mythmon	oh, ok.
2014-05-04 01:18:14	chekkaa	as in selecting the lines you want with v or V
2014-05-04 01:18:24	chekkaa	then doing s/name/newname/g
2014-05-04 01:18:24	mythmon	yeah, and then doing s////
2014-05-04 01:18:47	mythmon	anyways, i'm quite happy with sublime.
2014-05-04 01:18:56	mythmon	I don't like Eclipse.
2014-05-04 01:19:03	chekkaa	why not?
2014-05-04 01:19:26	mythmon	my experiences with it were of an over engineered over complicated all-in-one tool.
2014-05-04 01:19:39	mythmon	it used a lot of resources, felt slow, and i didn't understand it or how to customize it.
2014-05-04 01:20:01	chekkaa	and I am aware I am being picky, I'm just wondering about the best way to get a full-featured IDE
2014-05-04 01:20:03	<--	Fyrexus (hoangt@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu) has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2014-05-04 01:20:09	mythmon	so now instead of using eclipse, I write code in an editor, I run code in a terminal, I debug code in a debugger.
2014-05-04 01:20:22	chekkaa	crazy
2014-05-04 01:20:24	mythmon	I would argue that a full featured IDE is an actively bad thing to hvae.
2014-05-04 01:20:28	mythmon	but then I'm odd.
2014-05-04 01:20:35	mythmon	and if I don't like my test runner? I pick a new one.
2014-05-04 01:20:39	mythmon	and I keep my editor.
2014-05-04 01:20:59	chekkaa	eclipse is not all-or-nothing though
2014-05-04 01:21:08	chekkaa	you can use multiple tools still
2014-05-04 01:21:13	mythmon	sure.
2014-05-04 01:21:28	mythmon	but why pay for the extra features if you aren't going to use them?
2014-05-04 01:21:48	mythmon	it's also possible eclipse has changed radically since last I used it.
2014-05-04 01:21:52	mythmon	it has been a few years.
2014-05-04 01:22:02	chekkaa	paying in resources?
2014-05-04 01:22:05	mythmon	yeah
2014-05-04 01:22:09	chekkaa	not too bothered
2014-05-04 01:22:19	mythmon	it's also true that most of the code I write cannot be tested in eclipse.
2014-05-04 01:22:35	chekkaa	fair enough
2014-05-04 01:22:49	mythmon	and most of the code I write, if eclipse can really figure out how to refactor it, they need to talk to some PHD people about static analysis, because they have broken some new ground.
2014-05-04 01:23:09	mythmon	when you write C or Java, I totally believe that Eclipse can fully understand your code.
2014-05-04 01:23:30	chekkaa	that's not true for python?
2014-05-04 01:23:32	chekkaa	o_O
2014-05-04 01:23:38	mythmon	But due to JS or Python or Ruby's dynanism, they are difficult if not impossible to statically analyze.
2014-05-04 01:23:43	chekkaa	I see
2014-05-04 01:23:54	mythmon	at least, to fully statically analyze
2014-05-04 01:24:00	mythmon	you can do a good job, you can't cover all cases.
2014-05-04 01:25:30	mythmon	consider this pattern: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/5057590
2014-05-04 01:25:38	mythmon	that pattern comes up occasionally.
2014-05-04 01:25:51	mythmon	try and get Eclipse to safely rename do_foo into do_baz
2014-05-04 01:26:02	mythmon	or, rather
2014-05-04 01:26:12	mythmon	do_foo and do_bar into action_foo and action_bar
2014-05-04 01:26:29	mythmon	if it can, I'm extremely impressed.
2014-05-04 01:27:07	chekkaa	I'll give it a shot
2014-05-04 01:27:40	chekkaa	that is, if I still have any teeth left after getting pydev working
2014-05-04 01:27:55	mythmon	pydev?
2014-05-04 01:28:02	chekkaa	the eclipse plugin
2014-05-04 01:28:04	mythmon	ah
2014-05-04 01:28:16	mythmon	also, i had a really horrible time getting and installing and using eclipse plugins.
2014-05-04 01:28:21	mythmon	Eclipse for Java? Awesome.
2014-05-04 01:28:22	chekkaa	eclipse is definitely a love-hate relationship
2014-05-04 01:28:30	mythmon	That version of Eclipse that Google ships for Android? Great.
2014-05-04 01:28:35	mythmon	Anything else? stab me with a fork.
2014-05-04 01:28:38	chekkaa	and yes, installing eclipse plugins is horrible
2014-05-04 01:29:13	chekkaa	sometimes you can download the eclipse+plugin bundle
2014-05-04 01:29:24	chekkaa	and then just have two different eclipse installations
2014-05-04 01:29:26	mythmon	if you are remarkably lucky.
2014-05-04 01:29:43	chekkaa	yeah...
2014-05-04 01:30:09	mythmon	i've learned that when you make big hulking systems, they are never good.
2014-05-04 01:30:22	mythmon	small systems working together are better.
2014-05-04 01:30:36	mythmon	eclipse tried to be many small things working together, but it failed and became a big system.
2014-05-04 01:30:41	mythmon	that's the goal of plugin architectures.
2014-05-04 01:31:17	mythmon	when all goes well, the systems are equivalent.
2014-05-04 01:31:25	mythmon	but when the go wrong, i'd rather debug the small systems.

2014-05-04 11:42:58	@hamper	bramwelt: good morning!
2014-05-04 11:43:10	bramwelt	hamper: You are much too kind
2014-05-04 11:47:33	Fyrexus	mm, yes I slept like a baby :3
2014-05-04 11:50:03	chance	mythmon: i dont know where i saw it, but i saw a program on github where the main app communicated to other instances over an irc channel which relied JSON between the bots
2014-05-04 11:50:12	chance	relayed*
2014-05-04 11:50:28	chance	err, i know where i saw it, i just dont know which project it was
2014-05-04 11:54:24	Fyrexus	Totally random question, but what bank doesn't have monthly charges? I'm sick of Chase's requirements and being charged $6/month. :(
2014-05-04 11:54:39	chance	chase doesnt charge you for anything if your a student
2014-05-04 11:54:50	chance	just go in, tell them and they'll fix it
2014-05-04 11:54:56	chance	had it happen to me after i turned 18
2014-05-04 11:55:02	chance	then i told them im going to college
2014-05-04 11:55:06	chance	more free banking after that
2014-05-04 11:55:17	chance	although for savings you might need a minimum account balance.
2014-05-04 11:55:42	Fyrexus	Welll... my 5 years has expired since I opened the account as a student freshman year..
2014-05-04 11:55:52	Fyrexus	and they don't have any other options for me at this point..
2014-05-04 11:56:00	 *	Fyrexus suddenly feels old
2014-05-04 11:56:58	mythmon	Fyrexus: I use Ally. No monthyl charges, and they give me interest on my checking account.
2014-05-04 11:57:15	mythmon	And any ATM is free for me to use.
2014-05-04 11:57:46	mythmon	though, they don't have any physical locations, it's all online. this hasn't ever really beena problem.
2014-05-04 11:58:52	bramwelt	Fyrexus: If you're in Corvallis, OSU Federal, in Portland OnPoint. I have banked with both and have had 0 issues with fees.
2014-05-04 11:59:38	bramwelt	Any ATM in the Co-Op network is free.
2014-05-04 11:59:57	bryon	i use OCCU
2014-05-04 12:03:53	Fyrexus	mythmon: I've never heard of Ally, are their local branches around Portland?
2014-05-04 12:04:06	Fyrexus	bramwelt: mm OnPoint, I've heard of that one, just need to find a bank sometime.
2014-05-04 12:04:53	mythmon	Fyrexus: there are no local branches anywhere.
2014-05-04 12:05:10	mythmon	they are online only.
2014-05-04 12:06:30	mythmon	which in something like 4 years has never been a major problem. deposit checks by taking pictures, get cash from any atm.
2014-05-04 12:16:41	deanj	Fyrexus: I use Unitus, OnPoint and OSU Federal. OnPoint is in the Co-Op for ATMs, but not for going into branches, so I'd recommend Unitus if you're in PDX.
2014-05-04 12:32:46	mythmon	chance: jnoah: terraria?
2014-05-04 12:32:52	mythmon	anyone else?
2014-05-04 12:37:25	spectralsun	can we call the new version of firefox autistic?
2014-05-04 12:37:27	spectralsun	cause it is.
2014-05-04 12:37:55	spectralsun	mythmon: been getting slews of bad behavior from firefox
2014-05-04 12:37:58	spectralsun	tried new profiles, no plugins
2014-05-04 12:38:02	spectralsun	>_>
2014-05-04 12:38:12	mythmon	spectralsun: what kind of bad behavior?
2014-05-04 12:38:18	spectralsun	well the tabs won't save
2014-05-04 12:38:26	spectralsun	and just now, I just lost my sesion somehow in place
2014-05-04 12:38:27	mythmon	on a fresh profile?
2014-05-04 12:38:29	spectralsun	when opening a new tab
2014-05-04 12:38:32	spectralsun	yes
2014-05-04 12:38:33	mythmon	they wouldn't
2014-05-04 12:38:37	mythmon	that's not the default.
2014-05-04 12:38:40	spectralsun	i set it.
2014-05-04 12:38:43	spectralsun	of course i know htat.
2014-05-04 12:38:46	spectralsun	that*
2014-05-04 12:38:51	spectralsun	restart saves the tabs
2014-05-04 12:38:56	spectralsun	when firefox restarts itself
2014-05-04 12:39:00	spectralsun	but not when I close/reopen
2014-05-04 12:39:45	spectralsun	also weird bugs like I just lost all my open tabs (5, because i have to restart every time i browese now -_-) when i opened a new tab
2014-05-04 12:39:55	mythmon	how do you close firefox?
2014-05-04 12:39:59	spectralsun	mod shift q
2014-05-04 12:40:03	mythmon	what WM?
2014-05-04 12:40:05	spectralsun	i3
2014-05-04 12:40:13	mythmon	it's entirely possible i3 is doing rude things.
2014-05-04 12:40:22	spectralsun	ok i can try ctrl w
2014-05-04 12:40:27	mythmon	tab restoring works fine for m.e
2014-05-04 12:40:28	spectralsun	q*
2014-05-04 12:40:51	mythmon	hmm
2014-05-04 12:41:15	spectralsun	mythmon: yep, quit with ctrl q
2014-05-04 12:41:18	spectralsun	same thing
2014-05-04 12:41:26	mythmon	weird
2014-05-04 12:41:32	spectralsun	mythmon: are you using like 31?
2014-05-04 12:41:45	spectralsun	nightly?
2014-05-04 12:41:49	mythmon	i just made a new profile, ran it with fx29, set the option to open my tabs from last time, and it is working grea.t
2014-05-04 12:41:57	spectralsun	ugh
2014-05-04 12:42:04	spectralsun	ok
2014-05-04 12:42:08	mythmon	I use nightly, which has an artificial version number of release+3, so I'm at 32 in daily use.
2014-05-04 12:42:14	spectralsun	mythmon: thanks for doing the test
2014-05-04 12:42:39	mythmon	spectralsun: you should file a bug and/or ask a question on http://support.mozilla.org/questions/new
2014-05-04 12:42:42	-->	drshoggoth (~drshoggot@c-24-20-19-95.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined #osu-lug
2014-05-04 12:42:48	mythmon	there is something wrong here. we should find it.
2014-05-04 12:42:53	spectralsun	mythmon: i have encountered so many with inconsistant behavior
2014-05-04 12:43:01	spectralsun	and i think some are tied to when i use plugins
2014-05-04 12:43:06	spectralsun	for example, classic theme restorer
2014-05-04 12:43:08	spectralsun	breaks customize
2014-05-04 12:43:16	mythmon	spectralsun: again, it doesn't do that for me.
2014-05-04 12:43:20	spectralsun	but only after it's been enabled and the 2nd time i open firefox after that
2014-05-04 12:43:40	spectralsun	it doesn't break it when it first installs/first restart after re-enable
2014-05-04 12:43:44	spectralsun	i have one good run of it on firefox
2014-05-04 12:44:00	spectralsun	then the next time i open firefox without restarting the plugin, customize is a white page
2014-05-04 12:44:31	spectralsun	mythmon: was this last update a huge codebase overhaul for firefox?
2014-05-04 12:44:31	mythmon	you have something really strange going on.
2014-05-04 12:44:39	spectralsun	mythmon: thanks for seeing what im dealing with here
2014-05-04 12:44:52	spectralsun	yes, it is very frustrating as i really prefer to work in firefox.
2014-05-04 12:45:03	mythmon	it was a major change in the UI and front-end-ey stuff, but I don't know details.
2014-05-04 12:45:26	spectralsun	i'll just hang tight for now, i suppse i can use 28 right?
2014-05-04 12:45:33	mythmon	it's possible.
2014-05-04 12:45:35	mythmon	it's not good.
2014-05-04 12:45:42	mythmon	you really should post a question to the support site.
2014-05-04 12:45:48	mythmon	there are some really good people there.
2014-05-04 12:45:54	spectralsun	yeah
2014-05-04 12:45:55	mythmon	how did you install fx29, btw?
2014-05-04 12:46:01	spectralsun	pacman
2014-05-04 12:46:04	spectralsun	-Syu
2014-05-04 12:46:05	mythmon	let me try that
2014-05-04 12:46:24	mythmon	I have been running from a tarball in my home directory.

2014-05-04 12:46:44	spectralsun	mythmon: ok, im going afk for a bit
2014-05-04 12:46:49	mythmon	enjoy.
2014-05-04 12:46:51	 *	spectralsun &
2014-05-04 12:47:23	mythmon	edunham: you use i3, yes? any oddness with new firefoxen?
2014-05-04 12:52:11	edunham	mythmon: uhh haven't noticed anything major
2014-05-04 12:52:20	 *	edunham yaourt -S firefox-beta-bin
2014-05-04 12:52:34	edunham	i really should make it just update itself
2014-05-04 12:53:10	mythmon	i think the only way to get silent updates in firefox is to have it in your homedir.
2014-05-04 12:53:34	mythmon	or i guess go find all the right files and set the right permissions on them.
2014-05-04 12:53:43	mythmon	or make a package that does that. that wouldn't be too hard.
2014-05-04 12:56:06	edunham	yeah, this would entail learning to make packages
2014-05-04 12:56:22	mythmon	in arch it is pretty easy.
2014-05-04 13:04:17	edunham	biggest hurdle is that i do'nt fully understand how the meta+d launcher menu finds programs to launch >.>
2014-05-04 13:11:49	chance	$PATH probably
2014-05-04 13:11:58	chance	or its own path that gets set
2014-05-04 13:12:05	chance	are you talking about pmenu/dmenu?
2014-05-04 13:16:13	mythmon	edunham: most launchers pull from $PATH
2014-05-04 13:16:23	mythmon	some also look at so called .desktop files in some magical location
2014-05-04 13:16:33	mythmon	spectralsun: i made this for you: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5795783/screenshot-20140504-19524.ogv
2014-05-04 13:16:44	mythmon	as proof that it works in at lesat one place.
2014-05-04 13:16:59	mythmon	also, watching myself mouse/keyboard around it almost painful...
2014-05-04 13:20:11	lucyw	Hey, out of curiosity does anyone know why contamination and propagation delays are named as such?  They don't seem to align directly with their meanings, and google didn't turn up much that was useful
2014-05-04 13:27:55	mythmon	lucyw: scope?
2014-05-04 13:28:02	 *	mythmon has never heard of contamination delays.
2014-05-04 13:29:35	mythmon	if you are talking about circuit stuff, i've always understood propagation delay as how long it takes a logical change to propagate it's changes through the system.
2014-05-04 13:29:55	mythmon	so after the appropriate propagation delay, you can now reason about the system as logic instead of electricity again.
2014-05-04 13:30:36	edunham	mythmon: scope is networking class, i'd guess
2014-05-04 13:35:22	mythmon	ah.
2014-05-04 13:39:51	lucyw	mythmon: Ahhh, that would make sense.
2014-05-04 13:40:09	lucyw	scope is digital logic design (ece271)
2014-05-04 13:40:26	mythmon	lucyw: so what is contamination delay?
2014-05-04 13:40:56	mythmon	oh...
2014-05-04 13:41:14	mythmon	looking at wikipedia makes me think contamination delay is the time until a new input erases the old output.
2014-05-04 13:41:20	lucyw	Well, propagation delay as I understand it is the longest path and therefore longest possible time to complete a given circuit.  Contamination delay is the shortest
2014-05-04 13:41:33	mythmon	that makes sense.
2014-05-04 13:41:53	mythmon	you can continue reading old outputs until they are contaminated by new input, and you can't read the new outputs until everything has propagated.
2014-05-04 13:42:14	lucyw	Oh!
2014-05-04 13:42:22	lucyw	mythmon++
2014-05-04 13:42:31	mythmon	did that make things click into place?
2014-05-04 13:42:38	lucyw	Yes.  Aha moment.
2014-05-04 13:42:40	lucyw	Thank you!
2014-05-04 13:42:41	mythmon	yay.
2014-05-04 13:43:07	mythmon	though now i am thinking about taking advantage of contamination delays to make faster clocked circuits.
2014-05-04 13:53:37	bramwelt	mythmon: stop it, you!
2014-05-04 13:53:57	spectralsun	mythmon: thanks for the video
2014-05-04 13:54:10	spectralsun	I will keep experimenting and let you know how it goes
2014-05-04 13:54:16	spectralsun	mythmon++
2014-05-04 13:58:00	bramwelt	spectralsun: You get the same thing when you disable all your addons?
2014-05-04 13:58:44	spectralsun	bramwelt: hmm?
2014-05-04 14:00:30	mythmon	bramwelt: spectralsun claims he gets the same behavior with a fresh profile.
2014-05-04 14:01:56	bramwelt	Ah, I didn't realize addons and extensions were linked to profiles.
2014-05-04 14:04:04	mythmon	almost anything that can change is part of the profile.
2014-05-04 14:04:20	bramwelt	cool :)
2014-05-04 14:04:23	mythmon	this causes some confusion sometimes. for example, reinstalling firefox rarely does anything
2014-05-04 14:04:31	mythmon	because that won't touch your profile (quite on purpose)
2014-05-04 14:08:35	spectralsun	i think it is a good design
2014-05-04 14:08:40	spectralsun	except all the damn sqlite
2014-05-04 14:08:58	spectralsun	makes it impossible to VC my stylish scripts
2014-05-04 14:09:08	mythmon	spectralsun: migrations.
2014-05-04 14:09:08	spectralsun	which, were all destroyed in upgrading to firefox autistic
2014-05-04 14:09:46	spectralsun	yeah, im doing the best i can to tell myself that i get to remake my styles and do them better...
2014-05-04 14:10:03	mythmon	spectralsun: the solution, of course, is to make stylish not store things in the sqlite databaes.
2014-05-04 14:10:12	spectralsun	oh, i didnt realize you could do that.
2014-05-04 14:10:15	mythmon	try dot.js for example, which reads from ~/.css
2014-05-04 14:10:22	mythmon	you can version control that.
2014-05-04 14:10:24	spectralsun	ok
2014-05-04 14:10:45	mythmon	or... maybe it's not called that.
2014-05-04 14:11:17	mythmon	ah, here we go: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dotjs/?src=search
2014-05-04 14:11:47	mythmon	spectralsun: I haven't used stylish. is the basic idea to apply a CSS style sheet that can override the site's native CSS?
2014-05-04 14:13:43	spectralsun	mythmon: correct
2014-05-04 14:13:57	spectralsun	there is some kind of api to do buttons to install styles
2014-05-04 14:14:01	spectralsun	akin to installing add-ons
2014-05-04 14:14:10	mythmon	huh.
2014-05-04 14:14:19	spectralsun	mythmon: http://userstyles.org
2014-05-04 14:14:19	mythmon	well, for the first part, dotjs can do css stuff.
2014-05-04 14:14:31	mythmon	there isn't any automatical installation stuff.
2014-05-04 14:14:33	spectralsun	mythmon: I am not big on the button feature.
2014-05-04 14:14:39	spectralsun	I do most of my stuff manually.
2014-05-04 14:14:50	mythmon	if you want to VC it, you should try out dotjs.
2014-05-04 14:14:54	mythmon	also, did you delete your old profile?
2014-05-04 14:14:59	mythmon	without backing things up?
2014-05-04 14:15:06	mythmon	you can't blame the australis update on that.
2014-05-04 14:28:27	spectralsun	i dont even know anymore, im getting firefox tsd
2014-05-04 14:28:34	spectralsun	what is browser
2014-05-04 14:30:30	mythmon	spectralsun: don't delete profiles.
2014-05-04 14:30:32	mythmon	just make new ones.

2014-05-04 14:44:22	spectralsun	no luck
2014-05-04 14:44:27	spectralsun	it got some random profile from february

2014-05-04 14:46:31	chekkaa	mythmon: so it seems to be that pydev renaming works perfectly
2014-05-04 14:46:33	spectralsun	mythmon: yeah, i acutally forgot
2014-05-04 14:46:38	chekkaa	after like 2 minutes of testing
2014-05-04 14:46:42	spectralsun	and i thought i had backed up everything
2014-05-04 14:46:47	mythmon	chekkaa: even in the pathological case I gave you?
2014-05-04 14:47:03	Fyrexus	deanj: thanks I will look into OnPoint and Unitus
2014-05-04 14:47:06	chekkaa	I don't see what was wrong with it?
2014-05-04 14:47:33	mythmon	chekkaa: it constructed attribute names via string concatenation with a parameter.
2014-05-04 14:47:36	Fyrexus	credit unions++
2014-05-04 14:47:53	mythmon	so knowing how to rename the things inside the string would be a static miracle.
2014-05-04 14:48:41	mythmon	chekkaa: in this example, rename do_foo and do_bar into action_foo and action_bar
2014-05-04 14:48:44	mythmon	https://pastebin.mozilla.org/5063503
2014-05-04 14:48:52	chekkaa	ooooh
2014-05-04 14:49:02	chekkaa	I didn't even know you could do that in python
2014-05-04 14:49:17	mythmon	the result should look like this: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/5063514
2014-05-04 14:49:20	chekkaa	that seems both dangerous and powerful
2014-05-04 14:49:40	mythmon	it, and other things like it, enable a lot of really awesome things.
2014-05-04 14:49:52	mythmon	this is what it means to be a dynamic language.
2014-05-04 14:50:19	mythmon	IDE tools are nice when they can be trusted absolutely, IMO.
2014-05-04 14:50:34	mythmon	but if they can't be trusted absolutely, you'll have to check them, and then you might as well not have them.
2014-05-04 14:50:40	chekkaa	yeah
2014-05-04 14:50:43	mythmon	so for dynamic languages, you might as well not have them.
2014-05-04 14:50:49	chekkaa	I see what you meant about java
2014-05-04 14:50:56	chekkaa	that would make sense in java
2014-05-04 14:51:06	chekkaa	since I don't think you can do that
2014-05-04 14:51:46	mythmon	I think you can do something like that with Reflection, but it has big red flags on it and isn't use much, iirc.
2014-05-04 14:52:03	chekkaa	also, minor victory: the code completion box in vim doesn't disappear if you typo and backspace

2014-05-04 15:26:24	bryon	akeym: ^^^
2014-05-04 15:27:12	mythmon	bryon: do you know the hostname?
2014-05-04 15:27:29	bryon	it appears to be oniddb.cws.oregonstate.edu
2014-05-04 15:28:02	mythmon	bryon: does  mysql -h oniddb.cws.oregonstate.edu -u youronid  work?
2014-05-04 15:28:29	akeym	use shell.onid to connect
2014-05-04 15:28:42	bryon	let's find out
2014-05-04 15:28:48	bryon	akeym: elaborate?
2014-05-04 15:28:57	chance	bryon: ssh to shell.onid
2014-05-04 15:29:00	akeym	log in to shell.onid via ssh, then use the mysql client
2014-05-04 15:29:18	bryon	what command exactly?
2014-05-04 15:29:21	chance	mysql
2014-05-04 15:29:25	chance	as mythmon has said
2014-05-04 15:29:41	chance	how else?
2014-05-04 15:29:53	bryon	i don't know, it's why I'm asking
2014-05-04 15:29:56	akeym	dont be snarky

2014-05-04 15:30:03	bryon	akeym++
2014-05-04 15:30:36	chance	well the first thing that pops up in google has like exactly what we said :\
2014-05-04 15:30:49	chance	!lmgtfy access mysql database from command line
2014-05-04 15:30:51	akeym	not an excuse
2014-05-04 15:31:29	chance	also was snarky because mythmon mentioned it above, so i kinda assumed he didnt try that advice
2014-05-04 15:31:43	chance	sorry, bryon
2014-05-04 15:32:55	bryon	yeah, you'll note that the first hit on google doesn't mention anything about osu, or CWS, or ONID or anything that is involved in this particular set of circumstances
2014-05-04 15:33:27	chance	but did you try it without the assumptions that those would make a vast difference?
2014-05-04 15:34:01	bryon	everything i've tried thus far has resulted in one error or another
2014-05-04 15:34:02	chance	thats usually my troubleshooting process, if i run into errors that seem to be specifically because of the school setup, thats when i investigate with help
2014-05-04 15:34:12	chance	you didnt tell us what you tried so far :\
2014-05-04 15:34:15	chance	or the errors
2014-05-04 15:34:38	chance	so to me, it sounded like you didnt try anything. so i came off a bit strongly, sorry.

2014-05-04 15:36:05	mythmon	chance: you're being hostile. please stop.
2014-05-04 15:36:10	chance	also, you need to make sure your using the db username, and password. not your ONID
2014-05-04 15:36:19	chance	which you can find on onid.oregonstate.edu after logging in
2014-05-04 15:36:31	bryon	akeym: not yet. my attempts are further hamped by some crazy shitty lag
2014-05-04 15:36:33	akeym	i'd link to the page that tells you that, but you need to be logged in first
2014-05-04 15:37:14	akeym	bryon: language, bitte
2014-05-04 15:37:54	bryon	gomen, it's frustrating.
2014-05-04 15:38:57	bryon	and i have now successfully connected
2014-05-04 15:39:15	mythmon	bryon: out of cursiosity, what are you hoping to do with it?
2014-05-04 15:39:45	bryon	just work with my database a little bit. get some more exp w/ sql command line
2014-05-04 15:39:51	bryon	doing homework
2014-05-04 15:40:31	chance	i thought they showed how to connect to mysql via command line
2014-05-04 15:40:42	chance	maybe they cut that from the class
2014-05-04 15:40:47	bryon	akeym: do i NEED to be connected from shell for it to work? i can't go directly from my home box?
2014-05-04 15:40:52	chance	yes
2014-05-04 15:40:56	bryon	ok
2014-05-04 15:41:00	chance	can connect from engr though
2014-05-04 15:41:25	chance	specifically im pretty sure its restricted to shell server IP addresses from ONID or engr
2014-05-04 15:41:35	chance	security
2014-05-04 15:41:46	chance	could try using it w/ vpn though
2014-05-04 15:42:18	bryon	makes sense
2014-05-04 15:42:23	chance	or could set up ssh keys on ONID, and an alias to ssh onid -t mysqli -h oniddb.cws.o.o -u bryon-db -p
2014-05-04 15:42:31	chance	thats what i did when i was using it from classwork
2014-05-04 15:42:39	akeym	i think its just restricted to campus IP space
2014-05-04 15:43:08	chance	i recall trying on vpn and it not working, but i cant be for sure. using vpn will tell you the answer
2014-05-04 15:43:10	bryon	unrelated: i just laffed at this gif my buddy sent me..  http://i.imgur.com/aOenemZ.gif

2014-05-04 16:05:00	bryon	yeah, but it just rejected my connection w/out that info

2014-05-04 17:08:47	mythmon	chekkaa: terraria?
2014-05-04 17:33:44	chance	bryon: you need to pass -p
2014-05-04 17:33:46	chance	so it asks
2014-05-04 17:33:55	chance	otherwise the mysql cli client assumes the user has no password
2014-05-04 17:34:45	chance	its a security thing, if it told you that it required a password, then you would know it requires one and that your connecting with the correct user
2014-05-04 17:35:00	chance	assuming malicious intent of course.
2014-05-04 17:35:07	chance	basically, tell the user as little as possible.
2014-05-04 17:35:11	chance	about why you couldnt connect
2014-05-04 17:35:46	chance	another thing is you can specify passwords depending on who/where a connection is coming from
2014-05-04 17:36:22	chance	so if its from my laptop, i could tell mysql no password for user chance, but always require password 'hunter2' from other IPs
2014-05-04 17:37:29	chekkaa	mythmon: yes
2014-05-04 17:37:45	chekkaa	python classes are hurting my java brain

2014-05-04 17:38:08	pono	Weyoun / jordane ping, I need help making sure I'm interpretting this question correctly
2014-05-04 17:38:31	chance	chekkaa: need help?
2014-05-04 17:38:48	chekkaa	I am discovering the joys of self
2014-05-04 17:38:56	chekkaa	and when it's implicit and not
2014-05-04 17:38:57	chance	non implicit this is nice.
2014-05-04 17:39:04	chance	its never implicit
2014-05-04 17:39:07	chance	:)
2014-05-04 17:39:14	chekkaa	it is when passing args
2014-05-04 17:39:24	chekkaa	all my function definitions lack self
2014-05-04 17:39:25	chance	oh, i see what you mean.
2014-05-04 17:39:32	chekkaa	so i had to change them all
2014-05-04 17:39:38	chance	whoops :D
2014-05-04 17:39:52	mythmon	chekkaa: actually, it is explicit there too
2014-05-04 17:40:03	pono	http://people.oregonstate.edu/~takamord/topo3.png
2014-05-04 17:40:10	mythmon	because foo.bar() has an implicit self, foo
2014-05-04 17:40:19	chance	the way it works
2014-05-04 17:40:46	chance	python methods have an explicit self when recieving, but not when calling
2014-05-04 17:40:55	chance	so self is passed auto
2014-05-04 17:41:20	chance	and the first arg to a method is always self
2014-05-04 17:41:23	pono	Since I know f being a continuous bijection implies being open, I'm hoping to show that f being open implies closed implies homeomorphism (or some variation).
2014-05-04 17:41:27	chance	you can rename self to anything
2014-05-04 17:41:29	chance	also
2014-05-04 17:41:48	chance	class Foo(object): def bar(this):
2014-05-04 17:42:03	chance	this == self == the object recieving the method call
2014-05-04 17:42:27	chance	the idea is methods are exactly the same as functions, the only difference is they get an argument passed to them automagically
2014-05-04 17:43:37	chance	i also like this example chekkaa http://stackoverflow.com/a/2725996
2014-05-04 17:44:06	chance	means you can define functions outside the class, and use them as a method for a class since self is passed into the function
2014-05-04 17:45:07	chance	unrelated, but robert downey jr posted this on fb and made me laugh out loud: https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1.0-9/10264829_287381191430353_1250218075995720679_n.jpg

2014-05-04 17:52:56	Weyoun	Well, looking up the definition of open function, it appears to be precisely what you need for f^-1 to be continuous.
2014-05-04 17:53:06	chance	i can cite it fairly well, but im just double checking here to verify
2014-05-04 17:54:18	pono	Weyoun, If f is continuous and a bijection does that not guarantee that the inverse function is continuous?
2014-05-04 17:54:24	Weyoun	So basically, A iff B easily.
2014-05-04 17:54:29	Weyoun	Nope.
2014-05-04 17:54:33	pono	Dang.
2014-05-04 17:54:48	Weyoun	See the map f:[0,2pi) → S_1
2014-05-04 17:55:04	Weyoun	f(t) = (cos t, sin t)
2014-05-04 17:55:13	pono	Oh right.
2014-05-04 17:55:19	Weyoun	Bijective, continuous, but the inverse is not continuous.

2014-05-05 13:26:12	vanrysss	mine is kind of a cluster
2014-05-05 13:26:22	ysnI	but I figured I'd rather have something working than get fancy with all the different java data structures and not have anything that can run
2014-05-05 13:26:26	vanrysss	but it works, so vov
2014-05-05 13:26:33	vanrysss	yeah same
2014-05-05 13:26:52	vanrysss	I have two dialogs that I didn't make actual fragments for
2014-05-05 13:27:02	vanrysss	I just put them into the one they launch
2014-05-05 13:27:08	ysnI	Next step is to make use of ConcurrentLinkedList and LinkedHashMap so parsing Arrivals can be multithreaded and lookups for Stop location can be O(1)
2014-05-05 13:27:15	ysnI	hahaha
2014-05-05 13:27:17	vanrysss	1000+ line controller class, but screw it, it works fine
2014-05-05 13:27:47	ysnI	I have this nice AsyncTask just sitting inside a fragment even though it technically gets called from more than just there
2014-05-05 13:28:03	ysnI	should probably migrate that out of there...
2014-05-05 13:28:27	vanrysss	tbh, I know I'm a pretty bad programmer...but the documentation and examples for Android aren't exactly friendly

2014-05-05 13:30:11	terrell_t	As last week's lug proved, acceptance testing is expensive. Breaks a lot of phones.

2014-05-05 13:31:10	vanrysss	just put the apk on dropbox
2014-05-05 13:31:17	ysnI	I want to parallelize Arrivals before that
2014-05-05 13:31:21	ysnI	oh yeah
2014-05-05 13:31:23	ysnI	could do that
2014-05-05 13:31:50	vanrysss	btw, ButterKnife is pretty decent

2014-05-05 13:32:40	vanrysss	let me know if you need help setting it up
2014-05-05 13:32:46	ysnI	I always have to collapse my listeners in Android Studio so I get the "(() -> stuff)" look
2014-05-05 13:32:56	ysnI	since the standard view is gross
2014-05-05 13:33:01	vanrysss	yeah
2014-05-05 13:33:18	ysnI	This may be worth looking into

2014-05-05 13:34:39	ysnI	eventually I plan on using Guava so the bouilerplate I wrote for dealing with basic filtering/de-duplication/etc
2014-05-05 13:34:43	ysnI	ew iOS
2014-05-05 13:34:52	vanrysss	there were some typos in his research paper

2014-05-05 13:35:16	vanrysss	I know
2014-05-05 13:35:28	vanrysss	the syntax looks really awful
2014-05-05 13:35:44	vanrysss	but everyone raves about how easy it is so vov
2014-05-05 13:36:26	ysnI	I guess building UX stuf fis simple since the designer is powerful
2014-05-05 13:36:46	ysnI	probably on-par with what you can do with Windows Phone or WPF
2014-05-05 13:37:03	vanrysss	doing UI for Android was a pain
2014-05-05 13:37:11	ysnI	but code generation can be pretty dangerous since you can get dug into a hole
2014-05-05 13:38:14	ysnI	Funnily enough, once you get past the hell that is configuring your project for Maps v2
2014-05-05 13:38:24	ysnI	Google Maps UI stuff is really really really nice to work with
2014-05-05 13:38:44	ysnI	but initial configuring is like trying to bathe a cat
2014-05-05 13:38:54	vanrysss	fair enough, I was surprised by how easy it was to set up location services
2014-05-05 13:38:58	edunham	ysnI++
2014-05-05 13:39:19	vanrysss	But yeah, finding a decent method out of the six or so floating around was interesting
2014-05-05 13:39:39	ysnI	Oh the joys of fragmentation
2014-05-05 13:40:04	ysnI	You actually need to use the one deprecated as of API #blah!

2014-05-05 13:41:12	ysnI	I think you managed to override every method Fragment uses

2014-05-05 13:43:49	ysnI	Hmm, I could see that definitely working nicely on a big enough tablet
2014-05-05 13:44:01	vanrysss	I have a nexus 7
2014-05-05 13:44:39	vanrysss	I am in the process of moving the dialogs to seperate fragments though
2014-05-05 13:44:52	vanrysss	so that'll cut out quite a bit

2014-05-05 13:57:02	ysnI	The one before the hackathon was about how interact with the server set up to get bus data

2014-05-05 13:57:27	ysnI	The last one was about this real-time web technology (similar to SignalR for any who know .NET) that could be used with mobile devices
2014-05-05 13:57:38	vanrysss	no mention of what it was, compensation etc

2014-05-05 18:59:02	thedjpetersen	for it to be rock solid work
2014-05-05 18:59:13	mythmon	fair enough.
2014-05-05 19:09:30	muricula	How do you prefer to write prose/design docs for your classes? Do you use a wysiwig word processor like libre office (I was just fighting its formatting), or do you do some sort of markdown to html to pdf conversion?
2014-05-05 19:10:09	muricula	It's also uncomfortable to write prose in vim because there are a lot fewer lines.
2014-05-05 19:11:39	mythmon	muricula: i wrote latex in vim. I don't recommend latex if you like your sanity.
2014-05-05 19:12:00	mythmon	I just wrapped often, and latex (and markdown, html, rst, etc) all ignore newlines.
2014-05-05 19:12:03	muricula	Yeah, that's kind of like writing html in vim, only a little lighter
2014-05-05 19:12:06	mythmon	so you can have more lines.
2014-05-05 19:12:18	mythmon	i wouldn't call latex lighter than html.
2014-05-05 19:12:19	muricula	but wrapping that frequently is objoxious
2014-05-05 19:12:38	mythmon	auto hard wrap plus good re-wrapping.
2014-05-05 19:12:48	mythmon	both features of vim and any decent editor.
2014-05-05 19:12:57	muricula	how do I set that up?
2014-05-05 19:13:09	mythmon	re-wrapping is easy:
2014-05-05 19:13:29	mythmon	gq is the verb for it. so either V and select a region and then press gq or something fancier, like gqap
2014-05-05 19:13:43	mythmon	hard wrapping, i'm not sure off the top of my head.
2014-05-05 19:13:58	mythmon	ah, here we go. textwidth
2014-05-05 19:14:01	mythmon	http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatic_word_wrapping
2014-05-05 19:14:02	muricula	cool
2014-05-05 19:15:06	mythmon	some syntaxes automatically enable hard wrapping, i think.
2014-05-05 19:15:11	mythmon	or maybe that was just my set up.
2014-05-05 19:15:39	mythmon	muricula: what class are you writing prose for? do you know what an orphan line is?
2014-05-05 19:23:20	muricula	mythmon: thanks
2014-05-05 19:23:35	muricula	what's an orphan line
2014-05-05 19:23:36	muricula	?
2014-05-05 19:25:18	mythmon	muricula: if you don't know, you probably don't care about the things that make latex cool.
2014-05-05 19:25:43	mythmon	an orphan line is when there is a line of a paragraph that is all alone on a page, relative to the rest of the paragraph.
2014-05-05 19:26:08	mythmon	so if it goes new page, some words, new line, new paragraph, that's an orphan.

2014-05-06 11:41:12	jnoah	if you do a subscription. if you do one time...well, it costs a good amount more
2014-05-06 11:43:23	jnoah	heh, you can change or unsubscribe at anytime. so, subscribe for one month, then cancel i guess

2014-05-06 13:45:33	chance	jnoah: do you have a full fledged web browser from your terminal?
2014-05-06 13:45:45	chance	can you run chrome/firefox within vim?
2014-05-06 13:45:45	jnoah	yes, phantomjs
2014-05-06 13:46:01	jnoah	something close enough, yes
2014-05-06 13:46:02	chance	headless != full fledged
2014-05-06 13:46:07	edunham	lynx... though if we're talking about fledging, it's like an elderly, distinguished, and conspicuously moulting parrot
2014-05-06 13:46:20	chance	http://i.imgur.com/EUC2Uv8.png
2014-05-06 13:46:37	jnoah	there's a terminal browser that does yavascript and framebuffer video for images
2014-05-06 13:46:45	jnoah	can't remember which atm though
2014-05-06 13:46:46	edunham	chance: i can run firefox from within vim!
2014-05-06 13:46:49	edunham	:!firefox
2014-05-06 13:46:58	mythmon	huh. i'm running vim inside a terminal inside Atom.
2014-05-06 13:46:59	chance	ill be honest...its not efficient by any means on resources
2014-05-06 13:47:11	 *	mythmon stops that.
2014-05-06 13:47:19	chance	atm with all that its running at 2123M virt
2014-05-06 13:47:21	mythmon	i'll very likely continue using urxvt.
2014-05-06 13:47:31	terrellt	I don't think running a browser in your IDE is the big feature that should be touted.
2014-05-06 13:48:16	jnoah	terrellt++
2014-05-06 13:48:41	chance	no, but i dont think using text for a text editor is a big feature that should be touted either.
2014-05-06 13:48:43	chance	i love vim
2014-05-06 13:49:07	chance	but i dont like having text as the main way to define what my editor's capabilities are
2014-05-06 13:49:25	terrellt	Using text? Versus what?
2014-05-06 13:49:36	chance	a graphical toolkit?
2014-05-06 13:49:42	chance	of any form

2014-05-06 13:50:42	chance	while i wish we used java, it was easy to teach newbies labview
2014-05-06 13:50:50	edunham	it's the best way to avoid learning to write code...
2014-05-06 13:50:51	terrellt	chance: I'm of halfway agreement. I think "how many features enable faster development" should be the metric here.
2014-05-06 13:51:12	chance	terrellt: i agree. but faster development isnt the only metric necessarily either though
2014-05-06 13:51:14	chance	anyways
2014-05-06 13:51:16	chance	time for class
2014-05-06 13:51:27	terrellt	But I want to know the other metrics. =(

2014-05-06 13:53:16	mythmon	imo development speed and developer suicide rate are the only metrics that matter.

2014-05-06 13:53:35	jnoah	haha
2014-05-06 13:53:40	mythmon	if devs get things done with your tool, and don't want to kill selves because they use it, you've done a good job.
2014-05-06 13:53:48	terrellt	Ehh
2014-05-06 13:53:55	terrellt	Vim probably has a pretty high one at first.
2014-05-06 13:54:02	terrellt	It's the suicide to experience curve that matters I think.
2014-05-06 13:54:56	mythmon	i think that suicide rate should always be zero no matter experience.
2014-05-06 13:55:01	mythmon	dev speed can vary by experience though.

2014-05-06 13:56:00	jnoah	mythmon: what do you use normally
2014-05-06 13:56:02	terrellt	I don't know if it helps anyone here, but I mentioned last week I pinged github trying to get our organization a discount on private repos - they gave us 50 for free. They asked me to spread the word, so https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new
2014-05-06 13:56:09	mythmon	jnoah: sublime.
2014-05-06 13:56:18	mythmon	terrellt: nice!

2014-05-06 13:56:35	mythmon	jnoah: sublime had decent enough vim bindings. atom's are lacking, but growing.
2014-05-06 13:56:55	terrellt	Fuzzy search for files?
2014-05-06 13:56:57	mythmon	and the atom core devs see the vim plugin as a first class citizen.
2014-05-06 13:57:26	mythmon	terrellt: it has ctrl+t that they call "fuzzy open file"
2014-05-06 13:58:06	terrellt	Awesome! Does it have built-in inter-project grep?
2014-05-06 13:58:19	mythmon	inter-project?
2014-05-06 13:58:30	terrellt	Inner*
2014-05-06 13:58:33	mythmon	oh, yeah.
2014-05-06 13:58:41	mythmon	ctrl+shift+f, works like sublime.
2014-05-06 14:00:10	terrellt	With good vim bindings seems pretty solid then.
2014-05-06 14:00:20	terrellt	I assume the git functionality is pretty good, considering its origins
2014-05-06 14:00:22	jnoah	mythmon: hmm, the vim bindings look decent once the current roadmap is complete. i may have to try it out
2014-05-06 14:00:42	mythmon	yeah, right now the major thing i am missing is f/t/F/T
2014-05-06 14:01:03	terrellt	Oh, that's kind of a big deal
2014-05-06 14:01:15	mythmon	yeah
2014-05-06 14:01:30	mythmon	it's on the roadmap, there are issues, developement is rapid. I think it is blocked on some core updates.
2014-05-06 14:03:33	chance	yeah, its open source, code is relatively straight forward, so progress can be as fast as you want it to be technically
2014-05-06 14:04:49	chance	pwnguin: did you see terrellt's message above?

2014-05-06 17:31:33	chance	they've tested html5 a bit already
2014-05-06 17:31:39	chance	the html5 player is literally the same thing
2014-05-06 17:31:57	chance	one of the biggest problems they had testing html5 was that they couldnt overlay captions on the video

2014-05-06 17:32:59	jordane	yeah

2014-05-06 18:24:05	shieldal	Is the voting first past the post or some kind of instant run-off system?

2014-05-06 18:27:48	chance	yeah, i feel like i should have known about it
2014-05-06 18:28:30	frostsnow	It's okay. From what I've picked up in sardonic snickerings, Americans are known for being blithely ignorant about foreign cultures.
2014-05-06 18:28:50	frostsnow	Not sure why. Could be culture, could be education.
2014-05-06 18:28:54	 *	frostsnow shrugs
2014-05-06 18:31:08	shieldal	I can't say I'm surprised that someone wouldn't know about something that doesn't effect them
2014-05-06 18:33:21	frostsnow	There's a view of life that believes there is a very minimal amount of knowledge that one needs in order to be a well-informed citizen, even if some of that knowledge does not apply to that person's day-to-day living and ambitions.
2014-05-06 18:38:56	mythmon	shieldal: if you want to change the voting procedure, there are rules for creating amendments to the lug constitution and/or rules.
2014-05-06 18:41:13	shieldal	I was mostly joking, a simple voting method is probably fine in this senario
2014-05-06 18:42:04	mythmon	(if i were still a voting member) i would vote to change the voting procedure to something besides FPTP
2014-05-06 18:42:28	shirgan	Write it shieldal
2014-05-06 18:42:33	shirgan	I will vote for it
2014-05-06 18:42:49	dot1q_	Seconded
2014-05-06 18:44:05	shieldal	But wouldn't it take 2 years for it to get implemented? Kappa

2014-05-06 22:46:50	PBJmonster	a few of us had a bit of a discussion about having a kind of ramp up program to get newbies started with linux
2014-05-06 22:47:02	edunham	PBJmonster: are you familiar with DevOps Bootcamp?
2014-05-06 22:47:10	edunham	it's a thing that the OSL has been doing this year for exactly that purpose
2014-05-06 22:47:28	edunham	but if you aren't, it means our advertising wasn't good enough :3
2014-05-06 22:47:33	edunham	where would you look to find such a program?
2014-05-06 22:48:31	PBJmonster	hmm, I think it could be incorporated into the bootcamp
2014-05-06 22:48:41	edunham	what were you thinking of having?
2014-05-06 22:49:25	PBJmonster	I'm used to ranking in scouting
2014-05-06 22:49:51	PBJmonster	where as you do ranks, or projects, you get recognized for your level of expertise
2014-05-06 22:50:00	bryon	Achievements
2014-05-06 22:50:02	edunham	ooh and like badges for tangentially related topics?
2014-05-06 22:50:02	bryon	CHEEVOS
2014-05-06 22:50:07	edunham	gamification!
2014-05-06 22:50:10	PBJmonster	yeah1
2014-05-06 22:50:10	bryon	yup
2014-05-06 22:50:16	bryon	PBJmonster++
2014-05-06 22:50:20	bryon	good thought
2014-05-06 22:50:45	PBJmonster	but instead of ranks, and trying to rise up the ranks or something, we could just have building projects
2014-05-06 22:50:55	PBJmonster	so each project builds off the last one
2014-05-06 22:51:02	edunham	kinda like http://eudyptula-challenge.org/ is for kernel hacking?
2014-05-06 22:51:03	PBJmonster	and builds your skill set each time
2014-05-06 22:51:14	edunham	there are some security challenges that work the same way
2014-05-06 22:52:14	edunham	one of the things we're gonna fix about devops bootcamp for the next time around is adding a *lot* more hands-on exercises
2014-05-06 22:52:24	edunham	so you can watch lecture, do assignment, get graded by a script
2014-05-06 22:53:01	PBJmonster	I think the *context* of it would be really helpful
2014-05-06 22:53:24	PBJmonster	so if I'm intermediate and I'm working on project 3, I can ask someone questions
2014-05-06 22:53:41	PBJmonster	and mention I finished project 2, so we have a starting point of what I know already
2014-05-06 22:54:06	edunham	good point
2014-05-06 22:54:17	edunham	would you like to write up a few example projects and have a place to put them on the lug github?
2014-05-06 22:54:48	PBJmonster	I could write up some newbie ones as that is as far as I'm qualified :p
2014-05-06 22:55:17	edunham	also a list of topics that you'd like such lessons on would be super helpful
2014-05-06 22:55:22	edunham	we could probably get people to do them
2014-05-06 22:55:26	edunham	s/do/make/
2014-05-06 22:55:27	@hamper	edunham actually meant: we could probably get people to make them
2014-05-06 22:55:39	edunham	but it'd require a really clear explanation of what, exactly, they're supposed to be making
2014-05-06 22:55:48	PBJmonster	yeah,
2014-05-06 22:56:04	PBJmonster	since I'm not super familiar with the amount of stuff that can get done
2014-05-06 22:56:15	PBJmonster	it would be great to hear about the cool stuff that people use linux for
2014-05-06 22:56:29	PBJmonster	and then based on that set up lesson paths to get there
2014-05-06 22:56:43	PBJmonster	but maybe projects, not lessons, cause school blows
2014-05-06 22:56:45	edunham	yeah and we like teaching... the hard part is defining the scope and format of what you want from us
2014-05-06 22:57:27	PBJmonster	I guess the most scoped question I can think of is "What cool things do you do with Linux, and how do you do them?"
2014-05-06 22:58:04	PBJmonster	I know basic Shell scripting, so that could be the first project
2014-05-06 22:58:20	edunham	yeah i guess the usual answer to "what cool things do you do" is along the lines that things one person finds cool might bore another
2014-05-06 22:58:24	edunham	and to ask what you *want* to do
2014-05-06 22:58:29	edunham	though i know that's incomplete and unsatisfactory
2014-05-06 22:58:46	PBJmonster	no worries, it's a thought in progress
2014-05-06 22:59:08	edunham	yep
2014-05-06 22:59:22	PBJmonster	I guess the first lesson could be getting something set up to show an HTML page
2014-05-06 22:59:31	PBJmonster	and then building it up using command line
2014-05-06 22:59:33	edunham	I'd be kind of concerned about teaching a "here are the basics" course and actually filling it with fun trivia
2014-05-06 22:59:46	edunham	'cause like... here's-fun-trivia is totally legitimate and awesome
2014-05-06 22:59:57	bryon	DID SOMEONE SAY TRIVIA!?
2014-05-06 23:00:06	 *	bryon settles down.
2014-05-06 23:00:09	edunham	bryon: congrats on highlighting on it...
2014-05-06 23:00:29	bryon	highlighting? what means this "highlighting" you speak of?
2014-05-06 23:00:31	edunham	PBJmonster: seems to me that basic shell commands are way earlier in one's learning process than deploying a webserver
2014-05-06 23:00:38	edunham	bryon: that thing where you turn funny colors when people yell at you
2014-05-06 23:00:44	edunham	s/you/your irc/
2014-05-06 23:00:44	@hamper	edunham actually meant: bryon: that thing where your irc turn funny colors when people yell at you
2014-05-06 23:00:49	bryon	heh
2014-05-06 23:00:54	bryon	i only highlight on my name
2014-05-06 23:01:04	bryon	and even then, i think it only works if my name was the first thing on the line
2014-05-06 23:01:06	edunham	bryon: yeah that's the default
2014-05-06 23:03:41	PBJmonster	I'll think some more about it before the next meeting
2014-05-06 23:04:10	edunham	PBJmonster: awesome :D
2014-05-06 23:04:27	edunham	if you could put together an example of one teaching a topic that you do know, even if it's super basic, it'd help us all understand
2014-05-06 23:04:57	PBJmonster	ok, sounds good!
2014-05-06 23:05:23	edunham	awesome!

2014-05-07 00:20:41	mythmon	er... i think
2014-05-07 00:20:54	mythmon	whatever malloc error handling is, if it is not triggered, the address is valid.,
2014-05-07 00:21:16	mythmon	now, given a random memory address, how do you determine if it is readable? I'm not sure if that's possible, but then why are you doing that.
2014-05-07 00:27:34	muricula	testing
2014-05-07 00:29:42	mythmon	muricula: you might also give man 3 malloc a read.

2014-05-07 05:40:00	teiresias	Also, due to the way memory allocation works in Linux, the fact that malloc returns non-NULL doesn't necessarily mean that the memory is available.
2014-05-07 05:40:58	teiresias	But you can't really test for this I think.  If the system is out of memory, the kernel OOM killer will just kill a random process.
2014-05-07 05:45:03	teiresias	Anyway not sure why you'd need to test a random memory address to make sure it's readable, aside from "for shits and grins", but I'm pretty sure you can do it by trapping SIGSEGV.

2014-05-07 09:29:24	jordane	60C is uncomfortably warm for me. Typically because the fans get loud enough to annoy me.
2014-05-07 09:29:47	Fyrexus	My fan is actually set to turn on around 45 C... and it's really loud until I order a new one

2014-05-07 18:20:32	frostsnow	Radeon is more Open-Source friendly than NVIDIA, correct? I'm asking because I'm looking to buy a new graphics card and would rather support the lesser of two Evils...
2014-05-07 18:21:56	pop_n_fresh	frostsnow: Do you want to support a company taht is friendly to Open Source or will give you drivers?
2014-05-07 18:22:15	frostsnow	pop_n_fresh: In general, yes
2014-05-07 18:22:16	pop_n_fresh	NVIDIA has been pretty good (allegedly) about driver support for Linux recently.
2014-05-07 18:22:30	frostsnow	That's a recent thing
2014-05-07 18:22:35	frostsnow	And I mean Open Source drivers
2014-05-07 18:23:03	pop_n_fresh	The NVIDIA Open Source driver's arent' that great, but the proprietary ones are very good.
2014-05-07 18:23:26	frostsnow	Last I heard Radeon did a better job providing graphics card documentation, but I'm really not up-to-date on these things
2014-05-07 18:23:39	pop_n_fresh	Do you need graphics card documentation?
2014-05-07 18:23:49	frostsnow	Hmm. Yeah, I'm not sticking NVIDIA binary drivers in my computer
2014-05-07 18:24:08	frostsnow	No, but it helps the Open Source community. I may even try and read the one for my card one of these days :P
2014-05-07 18:24:23	pop_n_fresh	Then I'd go with Radeon.
2014-05-07 18:24:37	frostsnow	Hmm okay. Thanks for the advice
2014-05-07 18:24:40	frostsnow	pop_n_fresh++
2014-05-07 18:25:09	frostsnow	Also, my Client for Senior Design from NVIDIA was an ass.
2014-05-07 18:25:39	frostsnow	I know, I know, that doesn't necessarily speak of the company as a whole, but still makes me a bit more disdainful
2014-05-07 18:26:10	pop_n_fresh	Yeah, I'm sure it'll be okay either way. I bet there's a forum for this kind of thing...
2014-05-07 18:26:52	pop_n_fresh	I have a C++ classes question.
2014-05-07 18:27:18	frostsnow	Probably. Forums can be difficult to get a big-picture idea when when you're new; I prefer to ask people I know somewhat (hence why I'm asking in LUG)
2014-05-07 18:27:34	frostsnow	Go ahead, I probably don't know the answer, but go ahead :P
2014-05-07 18:28:11	pop_n_fresh	frostsnow: I gotcha. I never really paid attention to my Graphics Card docs. I just felt lucky to get them to work as well as they did on Windows.
2014-05-07 18:28:36	pop_n_fresh	*typing problem*
2014-05-07 18:29:14	frostsnow	Neither have I, but my Senior Design project involved programming a graphics card (using CUDA), so I may be able to make sense of some of the documentation. Dunno.
2014-05-07 18:31:15	pop_n_fresh	So I've got class 'Poker' which public inherits 'Game'. Game has a virtual function 'start_game()' and Poker has a void function 'start_game()'. I created an object Game *g and set it to a 'new Poker'. when I call g->start_game() I get Poker's start_game() (just like I wanted), but I can't call any of Poker's other functions, only Game's functions.
2014-05-07 18:31:30	pop_n_fresh	Sorry, I'm not great at explaining this. I can paste code if you need it.
2014-05-07 18:32:29	pop_n_fresh	Example: g->[poker function] doesn't work (it wont' compile with clang), but g->[game function] works fine.
2014-05-07 18:32:43	shirgan	pop_n_fresh: If it's not a function that 'Game' has, then you can't call it from a pointer to 'Game'. You could create more virtual functions in Game, or find a different way to do it.
2014-05-07 18:33:23	pop_n_fresh	Do you have any ideas as to what a 'differen't way' would look like?
2014-05-07 18:33:55	pop_n_fresh	shirgan^
2014-05-07 18:34:58	pop_n_fresh	*moving help conversation to ##osu-eecs162*
2014-05-07 18:35:54	frostsnow	I've honestly never bothered to fully learn C++. I'm also honestly not sure if C++ is even truely useful since it's so weird, yet C is definitely lacking just a little...

2014-05-07 18:39:57	_Alice_	frostsnow: well
2014-05-07 18:40:05	_Alice_	how do you do OOP when using c
2014-05-07 18:40:06	_Alice_	C
2014-05-07 18:40:08	_Alice_	you don't
2014-05-07 18:40:40	frostsnow	_Alice_: You can
2014-05-07 18:40:42	edunham	_Alice_: structs and stuff
2014-05-07 18:40:48	_Alice_	structs don't count
2014-05-07 18:40:51	_Alice_	it's not pure OOP
2014-05-07 18:40:58	_Alice_	well
2014-05-07 18:40:58	frostsnow	There's absolutely zero difference between a struct and a class; they're both composite types.
2014-05-07 18:41:01	_Alice_	neither is C++ or Java

2014-05-07 18:41:06	_Alice_	frostsnow: not in C
2014-05-07 18:41:11	_Alice_	in C++ they are the same
2014-05-07 18:41:27	_Alice_	but structs cannot have their own functions in C
2014-05-07 18:41:33	_Alice_	unless the standard is different
2014-05-07 18:41:54	_Alice_	also it's forced compared to C++
2014-05-07 18:41:55	pop_n_fresh	shirgan++
2014-05-07 18:42:04	_Alice_	so idk
2014-05-07 18:42:07	frostsnow	Kind of. They can't have formal methods, but you can do ##struct_name##_function(struct* blah, ...);
2014-05-07 18:42:10	_Alice_	also C doens't have inhereitance

2014-05-07 18:42:42	_Alice_	n
2014-05-07 18:42:44	edunham	_Alice_: ever looked under the hood at how other languages implement inheritance?
2014-05-07 18:42:47	mythmon	_Alice_: the term object oriented does not require inheritance.
2014-05-07 18:42:54	_Alice_	but it's reinventing the wheel
2014-05-07 18:42:55	mythmon	frostsnow: that's not inheritance, that's delegation.
2014-05-07 18:42:59	frostsnow	mythmon: ?
2014-05-07 18:43:16	mythmon	frostsnow: the pattern you described, holding a reference to another object and calling methods on it is called delegation.
2014-05-07 18:43:34	frostsnow	mythmon: No, not holding a reference. The struct is literally embedded within the other
2014-05-07 18:43:36	_Alice_	mythmon: that really changes with the people you talk to
2014-05-07 18:44:14	mythmon	frostsnow: same thing really.
2014-05-07 18:44:26	frostsnow	mythmon: So that's also called delegation/
2014-05-07 18:44:26	mythmon	_Alice_: class based OOP kind of needs inheritance.
2014-05-07 18:44:49	mythmon	frostsnow: unless you are suggesting just merging two struct's and their methods, which now i think you are.
2014-05-07 18:44:56	mythmon	which doesn't work, because it doesn't have any MRO.
2014-05-07 18:45:02	frostsnow	mythmon: MRO?
2014-05-07 18:45:05	_Alice_	how would you even do oop when you don't have classes
2014-05-07 18:45:06	mythmon	_Alice_: but not all OOP is class based.
2014-05-07 18:45:07	_Alice_	that doesn't

2014-05-07 18:45:14	_Alice_	my brain
2014-05-07 18:45:20	mythmon	_Alice_: it isn't Class-Oriented-Programming.
2014-05-07 18:45:26	_Alice_	it is kil
2014-05-07 18:45:32	mythmon	All you need is objects that can receive messages.
2014-05-07 18:45:37	_Alice_	>.<;;
2014-05-07 18:45:42	mythmon	Classes are just one way to describe creating an object.
2014-05-07 18:45:43	_Alice_	this is like redefining scripting languages
2014-05-07 18:45:49	mythmon	no.
2014-05-07 18:45:51	_Alice_	there are labels for a reason..
2014-05-07 18:45:55	mythmon	this is like using the original definition of OOP.
2014-05-07 18:46:04	mythmon	Java was not the first OOP language.
2014-05-07 18:46:20	_Alice_	no
2014-05-07 18:46:24	_Alice_	and it's not pure
2014-05-07 18:46:28	mythmon	true
2014-05-07 18:46:29	_Alice_	neither is C++
2014-05-07 18:46:35	edunham	C is just way less pure :)
2014-05-07 18:46:36	_Alice_	i think ruby could be
2014-05-07 18:46:43	mythmon	but for example, there is Prototype based OOP.
2014-05-07 18:47:09	mythmon	JS famously falls in this category, but so do many other languages, including (technically) Ruby.

2014-05-07 18:53:31	pwnguin	not having a smartphone doesn't imply simpler; perhaps even more complicated
2014-05-07 18:53:46	_Alice_	i like my phone
2014-05-07 18:54:01	_Alice_	but social media can be nice
2014-05-07 18:54:44	edunham	more like just differently complicated
2014-05-07 18:55:20	mythmon	i meant to imply "simpler" in the same way that the 1800s were "a simpler time"
2014-05-07 18:57:02	_Alice_	i don't think not having a phone with 4g puts you in the 1800s

2014-05-07 21:59:37	jnoah	i already drink a ton of water, so that won't be too difficult :)
2014-05-07 21:59:56	jnoah	if i like it, i'll switch to a full month and just live off of it
2014-05-07 22:00:13	jnoah	it's cheaper than what I currently spend on food (i eat out way too much)
2014-05-07 22:00:14	mythmon	yeah, i think i might try it.
2014-05-07 22:00:30	mythmon	my interest is more about health than economics.
2014-05-07 22:00:43	jnoah	mine is both

2014-05-07 22:07:00	mythmon	lucyw: spend much time on hacker news?
2014-05-07 22:09:16	muricula	short of writing a program for it, how do I convert -559038737 to hex? Python's hex function shows a value with a negative sign
2014-05-07 22:09:26	muricula	so does google
2014-05-07 22:11:00	jnoah	muricula: ask google for an unsigned value?
2014-05-07 22:12:24	muricula	meh
2014-05-07 22:12:27	mythmon	muricula: why do you think the hex version of that isn't a negative number?
2014-05-07 22:12:57	mythmon	do you mean "how can I convert a number to a twos-complement representation in hex?"
2014-05-07 22:13:11	muricula	yes
2014-05-07 22:13:26	mythmon	well then that's a different question
2014-05-07 22:13:50	mythmon	muricula: do you know how to make a number into two's complement?
2014-05-07 22:13:59	muricula	I know I'm being sloppy, but it's academic - I really just renamed the test value from 0xbadc0de to 0xbad
2014-05-07 22:14:02	muricula	yes
2014-05-07 22:14:30	muricula	a = ~a; a++;
2014-05-07 22:14:33	mythmon	so you can do that to the number before you convert it to hex.
2014-05-07 22:15:08	muricula	wait that's converting to twos complement, not the other way around
2014-05-07 22:15:28	mythmon	so do it backwards.
2014-05-07 22:15:31	mythmon	a--; ~a
2014-05-07 22:16:10	mythmon	though, apparently python outsmarts us there too.

2014-05-08 12:20:44	jnoah	chance: i finally got atom to build on the windows box and a build in a linux vm. the linux build is quite a bit more stable, but overall it's still very alpha :/
2014-05-08 12:21:27	jnoah	i must say though, i do like the direction it is heading in
2014-05-08 12:21:45	mythmon	i really like how hackable it is.
2014-05-08 12:21:50	mythmon	it's slow for me thouhg.
2014-05-08 12:24:03	jnoah	i didn't notice the windows build being all that slow, though it had errors popping up all the time and was practically useless. the linux build was a bit slow, but a bit more useful, though i attributed the slowness to it being in a vm
2014-05-08 12:25:15	jordane	atom isn't too terribly slow for me yet, but I haven't opened 8 bajillion files yet
2014-05-08 12:25:20	jnoah	either way, on both fronts, quite useless still :(
2014-05-08 12:25:42	mythmon	also, i found one slow causing issue.
2014-05-08 12:26:06	mythmon	atom-lint has a bug where sometimes when it tries to read the environment variables, it screws up and leaves a process running.
2014-05-08 12:26:11	mythmon	and it tries again, and again, and again.
2014-05-08 12:26:11	jnoah	i played around with the rust repo. i had a ton of things opened, didn't notice any slowdown due to that actually
2014-05-08 12:26:19	mythmon	so i get a bunch of stale processes eating my cpu.
2014-05-08 12:26:28	mythmon	which makes everything slow, including aotm.

2014-05-08 12:36:00	chekkaa	it makes you sound disappointed
2014-05-08 12:37:02	jnoah	instead of just targeting linux because linux is awesome
2014-05-08 12:37:38	jnoah	they used to target linux, the unreal3 happened where they said they'd target linux -even said it on the box- but it never happened

2014-05-08 12:50:28	jnoah	yeah
2014-05-08 12:51:19	chance	yeah atom feels fairly beta/alpha
2014-05-08 12:52:42	jnoah	chance: turns out it's easy to build on windows if you actually follow the dependency instructions correctly (and but the source tree at C:\atom or deal with too long of file names...)

2014-05-08 12:58:29	jnoah	muricula: file path + file name on ntfs (maybe it's a windows kernel "feature") can only be 256 characters long iirc
2014-05-08 12:58:47	muricula	that's pretty short
2014-05-08 12:58:59	jnoah	ya
2014-05-08 12:59:24	muricula	is this true on modern windows, 7/8?
2014-05-08 12:59:40	jnoah	File names are limited to 255 UTF-16 code points.
2014-05-08 12:59:42	chance	i hear your having install problems, i feel bad for you son, i got 99 problems but windows builds aint 1
2014-05-08 12:59:45	jnoah	according to wikipedia
2014-05-08 12:59:59	muricula	that's lame

2014-05-08 13:18:55	fridgei	i have considered trying sublime
2014-05-08 13:19:13	fridgei	lately ive been using intellij and i really like it
2014-05-08 13:20:06	spectralsun	fridgei: do you like vim?
2014-05-08 13:20:10	fridgei	yeah
2014-05-08 13:20:17	spectralsun	sublime with vim bindings is pretty nice
2014-05-08 13:20:18	fridgei	i primarily use vim
2014-05-08 13:20:26	nibalizer	spectralsun: ew you sublime
2014-05-08 13:20:28	nibalizer	whyy
2014-05-08 13:20:29	edunham	i know mythmon and chance are pretty enthusiastic about the whole sublime thign
2014-05-08 13:20:34	fridgei	but for java and scala i use an ide
2014-05-08 13:20:42	spectralsun	nibalizer: because fancy scroll animation
2014-05-08 13:21:14	spectralsun	fridgei: yeah, if you aren't using eclipse for java you're probably doing it wrong.
2014-05-08 13:21:19	_Alice_	because text based programming is slower
2014-05-08 13:21:25	spectralsun	or intellij's java ide
2014-05-08 13:21:32	nibalizer	spectralsun: haha
2014-05-08 13:21:35	nibalizer	you should install compiz
2014-05-08 13:21:35	fridgei	i used to write java in vim
2014-05-08 13:21:38	nibalizer	and code into the cube
2014-05-08 13:21:42	fridgei	which led to me hating it more than i should have
2014-05-08 13:21:44	_Alice_	ubuntu has xompiz
2014-05-08 13:21:46	_Alice_	compiz
2014-05-08 13:21:52	fridgei	now i can just sort of face roll and hit tab a lot
2014-05-08 13:21:55	fridgei	and java code falls out
2014-05-08 13:22:02	spectralsun	nibalizer: i used to have that, back on ubuntu
2014-05-08 13:22:08	edunham	fridgei: heh, and comparable in quality to java with more thought put into it, i'm sure
2014-05-08 13:22:20	fridgei	well it does so much for you
2014-05-08 13:22:28	 *	edunham does not think highly of that language for many use cases
2014-05-08 13:22:37	fridgei	having access to docs is helpful because java is so fucking verbose
2014-05-08 13:22:39	fridgei	nah java is great
2014-05-08 13:22:43	fridgei	it just is no fun to write
2014-05-08 13:23:00	spectralsun	fridgei: oh come on
2014-05-08 13:23:01	jordane	it is also no fun to run
2014-05-08 13:23:01	_Alice_	ruby is sort of like the logical opposite
2014-05-08 13:23:13	spectralsun	if memory serves, java is just typing a letter or two
2014-05-08 13:23:17	spectralsun	lots of dots and enter
2014-05-08 13:23:21	spectralsun	(when in eclipse)
2014-05-08 13:23:32	spectralsun	tabs as well
2014-05-08 13:23:42	fridgei	well the verbosity is cut down a lot with an ide
2014-05-08 13:23:55	_Alice_	uh
2014-05-08 13:24:03	_Alice_	you can make vim do that
2014-05-08 13:24:03	spectralsun	i am trolling, i hate to write java.
2014-05-08 13:24:10	fridgei	you can
2014-05-08 13:24:12	_Alice_	Java isn't that bad
2014-05-08 13:24:13	fridgei	but it wont give you the docs also
2014-05-08 13:24:16	_Alice_	fridgei: one moment
2014-05-08 13:24:22	fridgei	no i have an exotic vimrc
2014-05-08 13:24:25	fridgei	im fine on that
2014-05-08 13:24:30	edunham	(exotic vimrc)++
2014-05-08 13:24:53	fridgei	my tools are the way i want them
2014-05-08 13:24:58	fridgei	i just wont write java in vim
2014-05-08 13:25:02	fridgei	or clojure
2014-05-08 13:25:05	fridgei	or scala
2014-05-08 13:25:06	edunham	(for phrasing, not for actual use... i personally dislike getting attached enough to special features that it impairs my ability to use vanilla vim)

2014-05-08 13:25:36	_Alice_	this is p nice
2014-05-08 13:25:50	thedjpetersen	why not use golang?
2014-05-08 13:25:52	edunham	yeah one of my bigger complaints against java is "i can't just write it"... always get stuck in a freakin' eclipse workflow of some sort or another
2014-05-08 13:26:00	fridgei	use golang for what?
2014-05-08 13:26:15	thedjpetersen	instead of java
2014-05-08 13:26:16	fridgei	i have no problem with go i just dont have use for it
2014-05-08 13:26:20	_Alice_	oh
2014-05-08 13:26:33	_Alice_	did the osu-secure certificate die??
2014-05-08 13:26:33	fridgei	thedjpetersen: thats an ongoing office feud
2014-05-08 13:26:41	_Alice_	do i need to use the new one?
2014-05-08 13:26:43	mathuin	I am enjoying learning Go, though there's a couple of folks in the channel who are somewhat annoying.
2014-05-08 13:26:49	fridgei	there are a lot of java people who would love to write go instead
2014-05-08 13:27:11	fridgei	but then there is a camp that is really in love with java
2014-05-08 13:27:15	fridgei	and more the jvm in general
2014-05-08 13:27:34	thedjpetersen	I feel like go code is easier to maintain
2014-05-08 13:27:36	fridgei	so its easier to sneak clojure, groovy, scala, or jruby in
2014-05-08 13:27:36	mathuin	I'm a little annoyed that go-mode.el isn't in the golang packages we have here, but it's easy enough to retrieve.
2014-05-08 13:27:52	mathuin	In the mid-nineties, there were people who thought the JVM was the savior of modern computing.
2014-05-08 13:27:54	fridgei	go is nice but we also have the problem that we are mostly on centos 5 still
2014-05-08 13:28:00	fridgei	so building go would be awakward
2014-05-08 13:28:07	fridgei	we would need a centos6 build box
2014-05-08 13:28:20	thedjpetersen	you don't lose any of the performance benefits
2014-05-08 13:28:31	thedjpetersen	this feels like bikeshedding
2014-05-08 13:28:36	mathuin	"If all computing operations can be reduced to 37 primitives, what if we only focus on implementing those 37 primitives on every system, then compile the source code to an intermediate which only uses those 37 primitives."
2014-05-08 13:28:36	thedjpetersen	so I am going to have to say blue
2014-05-08 13:28:49	fridgei	nah its just difficult here to get new langauges in
2014-05-08 13:28:57	fridgei	people get pissed when i write stuff in ruby even
2014-05-08 13:29:27	fridgei	python, java, or get into a huge argument
2014-05-08 13:29:29	_Alice_	that's sad
2014-05-08 13:29:37	fridgei	meh its a common problem
2014-05-08 13:29:38	_Alice_	ruby is p cool
2014-05-08 13:29:40	jnoah	ok, playing around in atom...package management doesn't work so no vim-mode...how does one text edit with out awesome keybindings????
2014-05-08 13:29:54	jnoah	so slow otherwise :/
2014-05-08 13:30:04	fridgei	ruby is fun to write
2014-05-08 13:30:10	_Alice_	yea
2014-05-08 13:30:19	_Alice_	that's why i like ruby
2014-05-08 13:30:20	mythmon	jnoah: what do you mean "package management doesn't work" ?
2014-05-08 13:30:20	fridgei	and it is as fast to develope in for me now as python
2014-05-08 13:30:52	mythmon	it *should* work.
2014-05-08 13:31:06	fridgei	the only thing i do not like about ruby is the community
2014-05-08 13:31:14	mythmon	jnoah: apm install vim-mode
2014-05-08 13:31:18	mathuin	My biggest problem with leaving the C/Python environment is losing the libraries upon which much of my work depends.
2014-05-08 13:31:19	fridgei	and tendency for people to write overly clever code
2014-05-08 13:32:04	mathuin	Rails has too much magic, but I don't know anything about the non-Rails Ruby community.
2014-05-08 13:34:08	jnoah	mythmon: windows build is broken and there isn't an apm
2014-05-08 13:34:37	jordane	mathuin: the non-Rails Ruby community has a not-invented-here attitude.
2014-05-08 13:34:56	mathuin	jordane: how frustrating.
2014-05-08 13:35:12	jordane	mathuin: Yeah.
2014-05-08 13:35:26	jordane	mathuin: Well, it's less of a not-invented-here and more of a this sucks so I'll roll my own
2014-05-08 13:35:44	mathuin	perl was like that when I first started learning it.
2014-05-08 13:35:49	jnoah	mythmon: ooo, found apm burried in the install tree
2014-05-08 13:36:18	jnoah	but the one built into the editor does not work on windows currently :/
2014-05-08 13:36:44	jordane	mathuin: They also have a huge fondness for curl https://something.io | sudo sh
2014-05-08 13:37:15	fridgei	lo
2014-05-08 13:37:17	mathuin	I'd love to know who invented that horrific pattern.
2014-05-08 13:37:19	fridgei	yeah ye old chef installation
2014-05-08 13:37:22	jnoah	mythmon: woot vim bindings :)
2014-05-08 13:37:28	muricula	jordane: that's disgusting.
2014-05-08 13:37:30	mathuin	I mean, you could at least read shar archives.
2014-05-08 13:38:18	jordane	Yeah..
2014-05-08 13:39:59	jnoah	chance, mythmon: which package are you using to have a terminal open in atom?
2014-05-08 13:40:53	mythmon	jnoah: term, but i never used it except to see that it worked.
2014-05-08 13:41:19	mythmon	and i doubt it would work on windows.
2014-05-08 13:41:26	jnoah	heh, probably not
2014-05-08 13:42:03	jnoah	mythmon: terminal-status, however, does work
2014-05-08 13:42:06	jnoah	on windows

2014-05-08 14:23:40	mathuin	Speaking of games:  listening to the Blade Runner soundtrack, one of the songs ("One More Kiss, Dear") sounded all fifties and all I could think was "Which Fallout game was _this_ in?"

2014-05-08 14:46:26	jordane	hamper: is there something about ruby that makes dependency resolution harder than any other system?
2014-05-08 14:46:27	@hamper	jordane: I don't know.
2014-05-08 15:08:13	terrellt	Ruby?
2014-05-08 15:08:55	terrellt	I missed fun conversations. =(
2014-05-08 15:11:40	terrellt	jordane: I'm interested, where are you seeing that part of the ruby community?
2014-05-08 15:14:05	jordane	terrellt: the curl | sh part? or the crappy dep resolution part?
2014-05-08 15:14:36	terrellt	Hah, the "not invented here" attitude, although the curl | sh is interesting too, and as far as I know dependency resolution (except for system dependencies kind of) has been solved by bundler for a while.
2014-05-08 15:14:51	jnoah	anyone know what >>>= in java means?
2014-05-08 15:15:49	jordane	Yeah, bundler has decency dep resolution, but gems sucks at it big time, which is still annoying at times. Chef is particularly terrible at dep resolution, as is berkshelf, and some other chef-related tooling
2014-05-08 15:16:10	jordane	not invented here is seen in a lot of the libraries that get rewritten just because.
2014-05-08 15:16:13	jordane	Like ssh
2014-05-08 15:16:17	terrellt	jnoah: Assigned version of a right shift.
2014-05-08 15:17:47	jnoah	terrellt: that's just >>=
2014-05-08 15:17:55	terrellt	jordane: There are benefits to pure-language implementations of an interpreted language, but I see your point. That being said, I'd say the majority of things shell out to better common libraries.
2014-05-08 15:18:07	jnoah	i've come accross >>>=
2014-05-08 15:18:12	terrellt	"Unsigned right shfit"
2014-05-08 15:18:15	jordane	terrellt: for example..?
2014-05-08 15:18:42	jnoah	right shift, zero fill, assignment
2014-05-08 15:19:07	terrellt	jnoah: http://henkelmann.eu/2011/02/01/java_the_unsigned_right_shift_operator
2014-05-08 15:19:45	jnoah	ah, yeah, thanks
2014-05-08 15:21:09	terrellt	jordane: Common xml parsers for instance use libxml, appropriately. There's no rewriting of that logic.
2014-05-08 15:21:39	terrellt	Things like image manipulation libraries use ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick, Vips, etc etc.
2014-05-08 15:21:44	jordane	terrellt: Fair enough.
2014-05-08 15:21:45	terrellt	Nobody's trying to write that in ruby.
2014-05-08 15:22:25	terrellt	jordane: Regarding chef, are you talking about chef's cookbook dependency management? Or with actual gems?
2014-05-08 15:22:49	terrellt	Gems are publically maintained, so authors don't always manage semantic versioning quite right, which is unfortunate.
2014-05-08 15:23:06	jordane	Yeah, that is unfortunate. I was mostly complaining about chef's cookbook dependency management
2014-05-08 15:23:14	terrellt	Ah, I don't know much about that.
2014-05-08 15:23:15	jordane	It's trivially easy to stick it in an infinite loop.
2014-05-08 15:23:28	terrellt	I've infinite looped bundler once I think, but that was an older version.
2014-05-08 15:23:41	jordane	It basically can't detect when it can't resolve anything
2014-05-08 15:23:48	jordane	it just stops and tries to resolve from the beginning again

2014-05-08 17:03:47	chekkaa	the way I have it, it doesn't do anything for single-line posts, and for multiline, you just do ctrl+enter for newlines or something

2014-05-08 18:39:43	lrr	i have a javascript/html question.
2014-05-08 18:39:58	lrr	say I have a page where javascript gets variables from the GET query
2014-05-08 18:40:29	lrr	and it does something with those variables. how would I set up the javascript/html to return information from processing that query?
2014-05-08 18:41:02	lrr	also, i'm not sure of the terminology on this so my google-fu on this is turning up results that aren't helping me
2014-05-08 18:41:50	fridgei	XMLHTTPRequests can take a callback

2014-05-08 18:43:07	fridgei	maybe i dont understand your question
2014-05-08 18:45:04	lrr	pretend I didn't say "GET". essentially what I'm doing is sending data to an endpoint for processing using javascript (checking signature). I want to then return json that says if the result was true or false.
2014-05-08 18:45:17	lrr	how would I go about that?
2014-05-08 18:46:08	fridgei	check the section in that link on async requests
2014-05-08 18:46:59	fridgei	i think the example might be almost exactly what you want

2014-05-08 18:49:37	fridgei	?
2014-05-08 18:49:43	lrr	yeah
2014-05-08 18:49:49	lrr	i'm using the jwcrypto library
2014-05-08 18:50:02	lrr	or rather i need the jwcrypto library
2014-05-08 18:50:08	fridgei	so basically
2014-05-08 18:50:11	fridgei	given some json
2014-05-08 18:50:17	fridgei	make an http request to some endpoint
2014-05-08 18:50:19	fridgei	it gives you json
2014-05-08 18:50:27	fridgei	and then check if that josn is the same as the other json?
2014-05-08 18:51:18	lrr	jwcrypto is running on the nedpoint, i want to verify something at the endpoint, and then return from the endpoint that status of the verification
2014-05-08 18:51:48	fridgei	alright so you hit the endpoint
2014-05-08 18:51:50	fridgei	want the josn
2014-05-08 18:52:02	fridgei	check it when the request is done
2014-05-08 18:52:07	fridgei	and then return true or false?
2014-05-08 18:52:19	fridgei	based on whatsup with the request
2014-05-08 18:52:22	lrr	yeah
2014-05-08 18:52:31	fridgei	just a sec
2014-05-08 18:53:12	fridgei	you are using the stdlib http module?
2014-05-08 18:53:21	lrr	i'm not sure what that is
2014-05-08 18:54:15	fridgei	var http = require('http');
2014-05-08 18:54:22	fridgei	are you doing something like that
2014-05-08 18:54:26	lrr	oh, no
2014-05-08 18:54:27	fridgei	then using that http lib
2014-05-08 18:55:06	fridgei	so are you saying you make the request and need to block until it is done?
2014-05-08 18:55:14	fridgei	or do you have other shit you can do
2014-05-08 18:55:46	lrr	sorry if i'm confusing you. i'm not sure what i'm saying.
2014-05-08 18:55:55	lrr	this is really my first intro to javascript stuff
2014-05-08 18:55:59	fridgei	ahh
2014-05-08 18:56:10	fridgei	its fine
2014-05-08 18:56:21	fridgei	the first step of learning is thrashing violently
2014-05-08 18:56:32	fridgei	at least thats how i do it
2014-05-08 18:56:32	lrr	fridgei: most of the website i'm using is a flask app
2014-05-08 18:56:55	lrr	but i have something i need to do with jwcrypto, and I'm trying to figure out the best way to tie in that node.js library
2014-05-08 18:57:04	fridgei	ooo
2014-05-08 18:57:21	fridgei	so are you hitting the endpoint in flask or another node app?
2014-05-08 18:58:16	lrr	and what would be happening is i ha ve the data in a flask function/endpoint, and then i need to somehow send it to jwcrypto to do some verification, and then get a response from the jwcrypto verification and then act upon that response
2014-05-08 18:58:34	fridgei	oo
2014-05-08 18:58:38	fridgei	so its being done from python
2014-05-08 18:58:41	lrr	yeah
2014-05-08 18:58:42	fridgei	id just use requests
2014-05-08 18:58:59	fridgei	have you ever worked with requests before?
2014-05-08 18:59:13	lrr	a little bit. the problem is i don't have the jwcrypto end point
2014-05-08 18:59:19	fridgei	oo
2014-05-08 18:59:39	lrr	right now i just want to shell out to node and run a script
2014-05-08 18:59:44	lrr	but that's really not the best idea
2014-05-08 18:59:45	fridgei	ugg
2014-05-08 18:59:47	fridgei	yeah
2014-05-08 19:00:00	fridgei	is there any reason it has to use a node crypto library?
2014-05-08 19:00:14	lrr	yeah, we're working with persona stuff

2014-05-08 19:02:28	fridgei	you could write a little stub js server i guess
2014-05-08 19:02:29	fridgei	and just hit that
2014-05-08 19:02:33	fridgei	shelling out is kind of gross
2014-05-08 19:02:36	fridgei	but that is gross too
2014-05-08 19:02:43	fridgei	sounds like you have a gross problem on your hands
2014-05-08 19:02:52	lrr	yeah
2014-05-08 19:02:57	fridgei	provided the flask app isnt huge
2014-05-08 19:03:02	fridgei	and you absolutely have to use ths lib
2014-05-08 19:03:11	fridgei	you could consider just doing it all in node
2014-05-08 19:03:34	lrr	i was thinking of creating an html document for flask to render, and somehow using that and returning data from a javascript in that html file
2014-05-08 19:03:57	fridgei	well consider that
2014-05-08 19:04:03	fridgei	so the client makes a request
2014-05-08 19:04:07	fridgei	from their browser
2014-05-08 19:04:37	fridgei	wait
2014-05-08 19:04:42	lrr	fridgei: a client wouldn't be making this request. the flask app would (which probably sounds more insane)
2014-05-08 19:04:58	fridgei	i dont see why html is in the mix here at all
2014-05-08 19:05:17	lrr	it doesn't have to be, i just somehow have to run the jwcrypto functions
2014-05-08 19:05:36	fridgei	then write a stub server that using that library in node and hit it
2014-05-08 19:05:41	fridgei	or rewrite it in node
2014-05-08 19:05:52	fridgei	i dont fully know what you are doing
2014-05-08 19:05:56	fridgei	so that might be shitty advice
2014-05-08 19:06:00	lrr	heh
2014-05-08 19:06:15	fridgei	but shelling out from your flask app to do something with node is a fucking bad idea
2014-05-08 19:06:26	lrr	yeah
2014-05-08 19:06:37	fridgei	if you wrote a small node service
2014-05-08 19:06:46	fridgei	that provided an endpoint you could query
2014-05-08 19:06:59	fridgei	that would be weird still
2014-05-08 19:07:01	fridgei	but less bad
2014-05-08 19:07:12	lrr	yeah
2014-05-08 19:07:14	fridgei	and again provided it is not huge you could just do it all in js
2014-05-08 19:07:32	mythmon	lrr: i quickly read backlog. are you expecting to be able to write javascript in an html file that changes the response when you request a url?
2014-05-08 19:07:50	mythmon	also, "client" in http terms is the one who makes a request, and "server" is the one who handles the request and makes a response.
2014-05-08 19:07:53	mythmon	client != browser
2014-05-08 19:08:00	lrr	mythmon: yeah
2014-05-08 19:08:14	mythmon	lrr: javascript inside an html document is 100% a browser thing.
2014-05-08 19:08:20	lrr	ah
2014-05-08 19:08:37	mythmon	if flask is consuming it, then the code to generate the thing you want has to run on a server, and then generate the right response.
2014-05-08 19:09:02	fridgei	yeah
2014-05-08 19:09:07	lrr	ok. i'll look at getting a very simple node server up and running
2014-05-08 19:09:37	mythmon	so if you want to do it in javascript, you would probably write a node.js http server that when it gets a request like "/foo?bar=baz", writes a response like {"foo":{"bar":"baz"}}, instead of some html.
2014-05-08 19:09:45	mythmon	lrr: so, hold on.
2014-05-08 19:10:00	mythmon	unless you really need javascript, if you already have flask why not just use flask?
2014-05-08 19:10:10	mythmon	flask and a node.js http server are 90% the same thing.
2014-05-08 19:10:13	lrr	mythmon: i need to use the jwcrypto node.js library
2014-05-08 19:10:18	mythmon	why?

2014-05-08 19:10:40	lrr	mythmon: it's for my senior design and we're using persona. i need to verify a jwcrpyto signature
2014-05-08 19:10:40	mythmon	I'm sure you can do that in python too.
2014-05-08 19:11:08	mythmon	lrr: ok. so you 100% do not need javascript for this.
2014-05-08 19:11:09	lrr	i could, but due to timing, i don't think i can aatm
2014-05-08 19:11:13	mythmon	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jws/0.1.2
2014-05-08 19:11:17	fridgei	yeah
2014-05-08 19:11:18	mythmon	bam. python library.
2014-05-08 19:11:33	fridgei	that didn't seem like a problem where mixing languages would solve it
2014-05-08 19:11:49	mythmon	lrr: also, have you seen https://github.com/garbados/flask-browserid
2014-05-08 19:12:01	mythmon	if you just want persona, you don't need to re-invent the wheel.
2014-05-08 19:12:33	fridgei	mythmon++

2014-05-08 19:13:15	mythmon	k
2014-05-08 19:14:05	mythmon	lrr: also isn't this super crunch time for senior design?
2014-05-08 19:14:30	mythmon	like, i remember the engineering expo being something like a week away by this point in the term when i did it.
2014-05-08 19:15:41	lrr	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7171/
2014-05-08 19:15:50	lrr	yep, it's next friday
2014-05-08 19:15:53	mythmon	k
2014-05-08 19:16:28	mythmon	lrr: ok, so you still don't need jwcrypto.
2014-05-08 19:16:32	lrr	why?
2014-05-08 19:16:37	mythmon	but the flask thing i suggested probably doesn't help.
2014-05-08 19:16:45	mythmon	jwcrypto implements an algorithm, which is used in persona.
2014-05-08 19:16:52	mythmon	what you need is an implementation of that algorithm.
2014-05-08 19:17:10	mythmon	i would highly recommend a python implementation of that algorithm, because you are already working with python.
2014-05-08 19:17:35	mythmon	i provided a link to a python package that claims to implement that algorithm.
2014-05-08 19:17:51	mythmon	additionally, if you must use jwscrypto, you don't necessarily need to do this over HTTP.
2014-05-08 19:18:39	mythmon	in fact, i would argue that http would probably complicate things even more.
2014-05-08 19:21:39	mythmon	though reading your thing again, it does look like it needs to be over http for some reason i don't understand.
2014-05-08 19:31:52	lrr	sory, my wife made me take a food break
2014-05-08 19:32:03	lrr	mythmon: it doesn't *have* to be over http.
2014-05-08 19:36:06	mythmon	lrr: i've got to do another thing.
2014-05-08 19:36:39	lrr	ok

2014-05-08 20:03:40	spectralsun	It was actually space quest that inspired me to start coding... Playing SQ3, looking at the pixels move around.. figured it couldnt be too hard, why not try?

2014-05-09 11:16:45	mythmon	spectralsun: Model.objects is what's called a ModelManager.
2014-05-09 11:16:51	mythmon	You can make custom ModelManagers.
2014-05-09 11:16:59	mythmon	This would have to be done as a common super class of all your modules.
2014-05-09 11:17:07	mythmon	additionally, i wouldn't recommend messing with it.
2014-05-09 11:17:14	mythmon	there is value in your code looking like other django code.
2014-05-09 11:17:33	mythmon	if you find it's troublesome, then you can add class methods like Message.getAllUnread()

2014-05-09 14:43:59	edunham	jnoah: what's it add over screen for you?
2014-05-09 14:44:15	jnoah	you can move windows between sessions
2014-05-09 14:44:37	edunham	hmm, neat
2014-05-09 14:44:38	_Alice_	not sure what distro to put on the nwetbook
2014-05-09 14:44:39	_Alice_	netbook
2014-05-09 14:44:42	edunham	is that something you find yourself needing to do often?
2014-05-09 14:44:58	jnoah	not too often, but everyonce in a while, yes
2014-05-09 14:45:26	jnoah	i'd like to keep irc in the session that i'm using. so when working on multiple projects at once, it'd be nice to move that window around
2014-05-09 14:46:22	jnoah	with screen, you end up using an external tool like reptyr or similar
2014-05-09 14:46:59	jnoah	oh, also the config is not nearly as crazy and is rather readable
2014-05-09 14:47:23	edunham	I personally find I prefer to keep irc in a separate terminal from my work, handled by my window manager
2014-05-09 14:47:26	bkero	If you're using reptyr/cryopid that often, you're probably Doing It Wrong(TM)
2014-05-09 14:47:56	_Alice_	i keep irc in a seperate tab in my terminal
2014-05-09 14:48:02	mythmon	i think tmux has a way to move panes between sessions.
2014-05-09 14:48:03	mythmon	or something.
2014-05-09 14:48:05	jnoah	bkero: i've never used repytr, that's just what i know to use if i ever wanted
2014-05-09 14:48:23	jnoah	mythmon: yep!
2014-05-09 14:48:27	jnoah	that's why i like it over screen
2014-05-09 14:48:37	_Alice_	if you're writing lots of your own configs in linux you're not lazy
2014-05-09 14:48:53	edunham	maybe, or maybe you just have a highly abnormal use case
2014-05-09 14:49:02	_Alice_	or this
2014-05-09 14:49:23	edunham	but yeah, i haven't even touched screen's configs yet
2014-05-09 14:49:23	_Alice_	but i have yet to write more than my .bashrc
2014-05-09 14:49:27	edunham	and i've been using it for like 3 years
2014-05-09 14:49:41	edunham	it just does its thing, and that's what i expect of it, so i don't really ask it to do much more
2014-05-09 14:49:44	_Alice_	i took a config from dotshare

2014-05-09 14:51:51	edunham	yeah i'm sure i'll form strong opinions as soon as i want screen to do a thing it doesn't by default
2014-05-09 14:51:53	Ac-town	they have kernel drivers for the mice also
2014-05-09 14:52:06	_Alice_	Ac-town: i like razer

2014-05-09 17:16:53	 *	bkero still can't believe you use a tool named yaourt
2014-05-09 17:17:27	bkero	"Yet AnOther User Repository Tool"
2014-05-09 17:17:30	edunham	it makes package management Just Work.

2014-05-09 17:18:23	bkero	You're right, I haven't
2014-05-09 17:18:35	edunham	i'm like "yaourt -S aseprite" and wait awhile and type a password and wait a little while and bam, successful install.
2014-05-09 17:18:40	bkero	But I have stared into the face of terrible broken shit. Its name was AUR.
2014-05-09 17:20:42	mythmon	what, a gentoo prefix that anyone can add to doesn't sound appealing to you?
2014-05-09 17:21:41	bkero	mythmon: It's called the sunrise overlay. I don't use it. :)
2014-05-09 17:21:54	bkero	edunham: Me and mythmon need to get you indoctrinated into the herbstluftwm camp.
2014-05-09 17:22:10	bkero	That way it can have 4 users: you, mythmon, me, and the german college student who wrote it
2014-05-09 17:22:49	bkero	Also: thorsten says hello from CCC :D
2014-05-09 17:22:49	jnoah	bkero: what language do you need to know to config it?
2014-05-09 17:22:53	bkero	jnoah: bash
2014-05-09 17:23:00	jnoah	ah, that's not bad
2014-05-09 17:23:47	mythmon	well, not even necesarrily bash.
2014-05-09 17:24:08	mythmon	you configure it by calling a binary with options like 'herbstclient bind_key foo bar baz'
2014-05-09 17:24:19	bkero	https://github.com/bkero/config/blob/master/homedir/herbstluftwm_autostart
2014-05-09 17:24:20	mythmon	make a bash file full of calls like that, and you have a config file.
2014-05-09 17:24:37	bkero	Also put the autostart commands in the file too
2014-05-09 17:24:37	mythmon	I have a script that uses python instead to do a thing.
2014-05-09 17:29:41	edunham	hmm. aseprite is neat but won't work -- it has no menu option for zooming in
2014-05-09 17:30:02	bkero	Wah?
2014-05-09 17:30:05	jnoah	wut
2014-05-09 17:30:07	edunham	ikr
2014-05-09 17:30:08	bkero	It can't just zoom in?
2014-05-09 17:30:21	bkero	edunham: http://www.aseprite.org/quickref.pdf
2014-05-09 17:30:22	edunham	none of the standard kb shortcuts work, and there's no 'zoom' in the view menu
2014-05-09 17:30:34	bkero	Pretty 1/2/3/4/5/6
2014-05-09 17:30:37	bkero	Err, press

2014-05-09 17:30:45	bkero	Well now you have a handy reference!
2014-05-09 17:30:46	edunham	ah, glorious.
2014-05-09 17:30:53	mythmon	edunham: btw, gimp?
2014-05-09 17:31:06	bkero	Go forth and make awesome art!

2014-05-09 17:35:40	edunham	mythmon: nah i do not have the skillzs for that
2014-05-09 17:36:16	jnoah	gimp++
2014-05-09 17:38:02	mythmon	edunham: gimp's pretty straightforward for simple pixel art
2014-05-09 17:38:19	mythmon	make a new canvas, zoom in a bunch so the pixels are huge, and then use the pencil tool to draw things.
2014-05-09 17:38:32	bkero	mythmon: does gimp have a grid view?
2014-05-09 17:38:56	mythmon	bkero: i think so.
2014-05-09 17:39:17	mythmon	if nothing else, it has a grid that you could configure to have a gridline every 1 pixel :3
2014-05-09 17:39:35	bkero	Aaaghghghgh
2014-05-09 17:40:00	jnoah	http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-view-show-grid.html
2014-05-09 17:40:01	mythmon	after poking at it for a moment, i don't think it has a pixel grid, sorry.
2014-05-09 17:40:09	jnoah	View -> Show Grid
2014-05-09 17:40:24	mythmon	jnoah: I think bkero was talking about a pixel grid.
2014-05-09 17:41:04	mythmon	jnoah: how do you configure the grid?
2014-05-09 17:41:08	jnoah	mythmon: you can prolly adjust that to fit pixels
2014-05-09 17:41:18	mythmon	jnoah: that is what i just said :c
2014-05-09 17:41:35	jnoah	mythmon: the link has a link to show you how to configure it
2014-05-09 17:41:42	mythmon	ah, there it is.
2014-05-09 17:41:50	mythmon	it confuses me that it is in a separate menu
2014-05-09 17:43:10	jnoah	muricula: not sure which channel you linked me..but ty for the haskell tutorial link. it's a good one

2014-05-09 17:48:35	jnoah	TIL it takes longer to build Atom than it does to build nodejs/v8
2014-05-09 17:49:04	mythmon	there is a AUR package for Atom now.
2014-05-09 17:49:10	mythmon	which is nice because it doesn't build into /tmp
2014-05-09 17:49:19	jnoah	nice
2014-05-09 17:49:30	bkero	Mine built on gentoo, but it was missing some libraries like gconf, cups, and udev
2014-05-09 17:49:45	bkero	So I mounted ubuntu in /mnt and did a LD_LIBRARY_PATH, then it worked perfectly.
2014-05-09 17:49:52	jnoah	lol
2014-05-09 17:49:58	mythmon	bkero: nice.
2014-05-09 17:50:12	jnoah	i have the needed libs in gentoo because I needed nm-applet :/
2014-05-09 17:50:26	jnoah	(vpn stuff for OSL)
2014-05-09 17:50:35	bkero	That would probably qualify me crazy by the definition of many people.
2014-05-09 17:50:50	mythmon	bkero: you always have the most interesting problem.s
2014-05-09 17:50:58	mythmon	also, when are you going to make an ebuild for it?
2014-05-09 17:50:59	mythmon	:3
2014-05-09 17:51:02	bkero	lol
2014-05-09 17:51:06	bkero	I could...
2014-05-09 17:51:08	bkero	It was rather easy
2014-05-09 17:51:32	bkero	I think I'm the only one in here who uses Gentoo, so it would be of use to...me and whoever else randomly found it.
2014-05-09 17:51:43	 *	jnoah uses gentoo
2014-05-09 17:51:48	mythmon	you'll probably have to go track down real libraries instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH hacks though.
2014-05-09 17:51:55	jnoah	i'm on it right now too :)
2014-05-09 17:52:08	bkero	I tracked them down
2014-05-09 17:52:11	bkero	I just didn't want to install that crap
2014-05-09 17:52:14	mythmon	got it
2014-05-09 17:52:16	jnoah	mythmon: there are a few big ones...but it's not that many
2014-05-09 17:53:32	mythmon	the arch PKGBUILD has these dependencies listed 'alsa-lib' 'gconf' 'gtk2' 'libgcrypt15' 'libgnome-keyring' 'libnotify' 'libudev.so.0' 'libxtst' 'nodejs' 'nss' 'python2')
2014-05-09 17:55:49	jnoah	and as bkero noted, caps
2014-05-09 17:56:11	jnoah	so, it wouldn't be that hard to do...just a lot of things to build :/
2014-05-09 17:56:49	bkero	I bet gentoo's gonna get pissed that it's building things in /tmp
2014-05-09 17:57:24	mythmon	yeah... that's pretty weird.
2014-05-09 17:57:55	mythmon	the arch one does INSTALL_PREFIX=... script/grunt install, and then it puts all the things in tmp into that directory.
2014-05-09 17:58:02	mythmon	though i imagine it leaves a bunch of shit in /tmp.
2014-05-09 18:00:06	bkero	script/build dumps a bunch of stuff into /tmp/atom-build/Atom
2014-05-09 18:01:16	mythmon	yes, yes it does.
2014-05-09 18:01:39	mythmon	i can understand why gentoo would be upset by that.
2014-05-09 18:01:42	mythmon	i'm upset by that.

2014-05-09 18:03:40	mythmon	does osx have a /tmp?
2014-05-09 18:03:44	bkero	Probably
2014-05-09 18:04:06	jnoah	bkero: have /tmp mounted in ram?
2014-05-09 18:05:09	bkero	no
2014-05-09 18:05:15	bkero	x240 only has max 8gb (1 slot)
2014-05-09 18:05:40	jnoah	i have 4gb with tmp mounted. besides building pypy, it does ok
2014-05-09 18:06:34	bkero	this builds chromium
2014-05-09 18:06:42	bkero	Go look how much disk space/memory usage building/linking chromium takes
2014-05-09 18:06:54	bkero	It's mind-boggling. It doesn't work on 32-bit systems anymore.
2014-05-09 18:08:04	bkero	and doesn't build on windowsxp
2014-05-09 18:10:11	jnoah	haha

2014-05-10 14:04:08	frostsnow	Hmm
2014-05-10 14:04:09	mythmon	frostsnow: try git diff -w
2014-05-10 14:04:20	mythmon	that will ignore the whitespace so you can see if there are any real changes.
2014-05-10 14:04:24	mythmon	though you should also fix the new lines.
2014-05-10 14:04:43	frostsnow	Yes, definitely
2014-05-10 14:04:44	mathuin	pro tip: do not enable fxaa on Ubuntu systems with Nvidia cards.  It fuzzes out the text.
2014-05-10 14:04:50	frostsnow	But this is troubling. It's happened twice.
2014-05-10 14:04:50	jnoah	frostsnow. dos2unix will convert line endings fvor you
2014-05-10 14:05:23	frostsnow	I can't imagine that the default vim editor for Gentoo has started adding ^Ms to files. That would be unthinkable
2014-05-10 14:05:34	jnoah	the ^M is the 'dos' line ending as read by vim
2014-05-10 14:05:40	frostsnow	The \r?
2014-05-10 14:05:53	jnoah	\r\n
2014-05-10 14:05:56	jnoah	iirc
2014-05-10 14:05:58	frostsnow	Yeah, but, why has vim started to add it to my files? That's troubling
2014-05-10 14:06:08	jnoah	the files have changed
2014-05-10 14:06:10	jnoah	not vim
2014-05-10 14:06:16	frostsnow	Hmm
2014-05-10 14:06:27	frostsnow	This -may- have happened for repositories that I've cloned from GitHub
2014-05-10 14:06:33	frostsnow	Because I haven't been having this issue before
2014-05-10 14:07:06	jnoah	git for windows gives an option to convert line endings one way or another
2014-05-10 14:07:09	mythmon	frostsnow: iirc, vim will switch to windows mode if it finds any \r\n in the file.
2014-05-10 14:07:21	jnoah	is windows being used at all for this repo?
2014-05-10 14:07:33	frostsnow	mythmon: That would make sense, but...
2014-05-10 14:07:34	mythmon	is it possible that someone you are working with is adding \r\n? or do you touch the files from windows?
2014-05-10 14:07:47	frostsnow	jnoah: That's exactly the problem. These files haven't -touched- a Window's machine
2014-05-10 14:07:56	frostsnow	mythmon: Nope! I've been the sole author in both cases
2014-05-10 14:07:59	mythmon	frostsnow: ugh
2014-05-10 14:08:03	mythmon	frostsnow: is it on github?
2014-05-10 14:08:10	frostsnow	mythmon: Yeah
2014-05-10 14:08:11	jnoah	frostsnow: only you and github?
2014-05-10 14:08:14	frostsnow	Yup!
2014-05-10 14:08:17	mythmon	frostsnow: can i have a link?
2014-05-10 14:08:22	mythmon	or a user/repo
2014-05-10 14:08:38	frostsnow	Both for 2048 (drkitty found them and removed them), and now they've showed up in my presentation
2014-05-10 14:08:53	frostsnow	Yeah, once second. The problem may be localized to my desktop...
2014-05-10 14:09:01	jnoah	frostsnow: link to repo?
2014-05-10 14:09:32	frostsnow	https://github.com/clinew/presentations/tree/master/fulldiskencryption
2014-05-10 14:09:41	frostsnow	This is the exact file I'm working on
2014-05-10 14:10:10	frostsnow	Interestingly enough, my vim isn't -displaying- the ^M's either...
2014-05-10 14:10:39	mythmon	frostsnow: bad news.
2014-05-10 14:10:44	mythmon	those files are all in dos mode.
2014-05-10 14:10:46	frostsnow	https://github.com/clinew/2048/commit/81272676f3c9e12705c2f9fc5d4f0d27f22a32f1
2014-05-10 14:10:57	frostsnow	This is also an example of drkitty removing the Windows line endings...
2014-05-10 14:10:59	frostsnow	mythmon: Hmm
2014-05-10 14:11:04	frostsnow	mythmon: Where does it show that?
2014-05-10 14:11:07	mythmon	and by "all" I mean presentation.tex
2014-05-10 14:11:18	mythmon	frostsnow: I did grep ^M *
2014-05-10 14:11:25	mythmon	where ^M is actually ctrl+v ctrl+m
2014-05-10 14:11:34	 *	frostsnow ponders
2014-05-10 14:11:39	mythmon	and when I openned it in vim, it says [dos], which means dos line enderings.
2014-05-10 14:12:04	frostsnow	Mine says [converted]
2014-05-10 14:12:18	mythmon	also, according to git, it's always been in dos mode.
2014-05-10 14:12:22	frostsnow	Well, I -did- get the presentation template from Kevin McGrath
2014-05-10 14:12:31	mythmon	well there you go
2014-05-10 14:12:37	frostsnow	So he -may- have edited -this- one in Windows
2014-05-10 14:12:42	mythmon	since the files were always in dos mode, there is no mystery.
2014-05-10 14:12:43	frostsnow	-BUT- that doesn't explain 2048
2014-05-10 14:12:47	frostsnow	WHich I wrote from scratch
2014-05-10 14:12:49	mythmon	ah.
2014-05-10 14:13:00	mythmon	well, run dos2unix on the presentations.
2014-05-10 14:13:05	mythmon	lets take a look at 2048 :)
2014-05-10 14:13:10	mythmon	is that at clinew/2048?
2014-05-10 14:13:13	 *	frostsnow doesn't have it installed
2014-05-10 14:13:24	frostsnow	It's the one I linked earlier, the commit from drkitty which fixes it
2014-05-10 14:13:29	mythmon	oh, ok.
2014-05-10 14:13:34	 *	frostsnow looks for dos2unix on Gentoo
2014-05-10 14:13:52	mythmon	if you can't find it, i bet it wouldn't be hard to convince vim or sed to do it.
2014-05-10 14:14:01	jnoah	frostsnow: emerge dos2unix
2014-05-10 14:14:14	frostsnow	Hmm. I also want vim to display ^M so this never happens again
2014-05-10 14:14:52	mythmon	frostsnow: out of curiosity, where did you get your makefile for 2048?
2014-05-10 14:14:54	 *	frostsnow begins building it
2014-05-10 14:14:59	 *	frostsnow thinks
2014-05-10 14:15:00	mythmon	because in your initial commit it has mixed line endings.
2014-05-10 14:15:21	mythmon	the license comment is unix newlines, and everything below is dos newlines.
2014-05-10 14:15:23	frostsnow	I made it... from another file
2014-05-10 14:15:34	frostsnow	Well, I wrote the origin file in my laptop
2014-05-10 14:15:47	frostsnow	Then copied it over onto my desktop when I wrote most of 2048
2014-05-10 14:15:54	frostsnow	So I think something funny has happened to this desktop's vim
2014-05-10 14:16:24	mythmon	everything else in the initial commit was unix newlines.
2014-05-10 14:16:43	frostsnow	Weird
2014-05-10 14:17:04	frostsnow	Maybe I copied the makefile onto a vfat-formatted filesystem and it auto-converted the file to Windows line-endings?
2014-05-10 14:17:22	jnoah	frostsnow: pastebin .vimrc
2014-05-10 14:17:40	mythmon	frostsnow: it isn't the entire file. only a part of it.
2014-05-10 14:17:51	mythmon	which implies that you either pasted the license or the code
2014-05-10 14:18:03	mythmon	so either you wrote the code in windows mode and pasted the license from a unix mode file
2014-05-10 14:18:04	mythmon	or vice versa.
2014-05-10 14:18:18	frostsnow	mythmon: It's GPU GPL, right? I copied that from the FSF's website
2014-05-10 14:18:39	mythmon	frostsnow: so then when you opened makefile, your vim got in dos mode somehow.
2014-05-10 14:18:39	frostsnow	mythmon: I think I copied the makefile from my laptop to my desktop and then edited it on my desktop before the initial commit
2014-05-10 14:19:03	frostsnow	jnoah: There's none under ~/ but maybe the default Gentoo one under /etc
2014-05-10 14:19:10	frostsnow	mythmon: Hmm
2014-05-10 14:19:10	mythmon	i don't think this is infectious. I think this is mixing windows and linux, and you should fix it and move on.
2014-05-10 14:19:13	jnoah	frostsnow: nvm then
2014-05-10 14:19:30	jnoah	gentoo's defaults are sane
2014-05-10 14:19:53	frostsnow	mythmon: Maybe. I'm inclined to suspect that my vim has gone wonkers somehow
2014-05-10 14:19:58	mythmon	frostsnow: it hasn't.
2014-05-10 14:20:11	mythmon	or at least, i have no evidence of that
2014-05-10 14:20:24	mythmon	because files did not spontaneously become "infected" in your git history.
2014-05-10 14:20:41	mythmon	your vim preserved line endings, and you just introduced a funny mode in some files.
2014-05-10 14:21:41	frostsnow	Fair enough. I may have copied the 'original' makefile from that other makefile I got from Kevin a long, long time ago, and have been slowly propogating ^Ms without realizing it
2014-05-10 14:22:04	mythmon	frostsnow: if you want more info, http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/File_format
2014-05-10 14:22:21	jnoah	frostsnow: and don't forget to emerge dos2unix
2014-05-10 14:22:28	jnoah	it's simple and useful
2014-05-10 14:23:05	frostsnow	jnoah: Yeah, I've already run it on the entire repo
2014-05-10 14:23:11	frostsnow	mythmon: *begins reading*
2014-05-10 14:23:36	frostsnow	I would like to change my .vimrc so it displays ^Ms like the Kelly computers did, since there may be other files...
2014-05-10 14:24:02	mythmon	frostsnow: settings fileformat=unix should do that.
2014-05-10 14:24:12	mythmon	if I understand correclty.
2014-05-10 14:24:29	mythmon	also, this link found at the end of that article, will make it very obvious if you are not in unix mode: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip736
2014-05-10 14:25:18	frostsnow	mythmon: That syntax doesn't work for the .vimrc file
2014-05-10 14:25:24	mythmon	uh...
2014-05-10 14:25:37	mythmon	set fileformat=unix
2014-05-10 14:25:38	mythmon	i think.
2014-05-10 14:25:43	mythmon	it's been a while since i've vimmed.
2014-05-10 14:25:50	mythmon	well, not really. i vimmed today.
2014-05-10 14:25:58	mythmon	It's been a while since i've customized vim.
2014-05-10 14:26:27	frostsnow	Okay, that works
2014-05-10 14:27:05	mythmon	I want to link to enough libraries to be able to rewrite xclip. Does anyone know anything about that?
2014-05-10 14:28:50	jnoah	mythmon: i don't, but possibly the makefile will tell you
2014-05-10 14:29:29	mythmon	jnoah: that's a good idea.
2014-05-10 14:29:35	 *	mythmon googles for xclips's source code.
2014-05-10 14:30:05	mythmon	also i want to do this from node :3

2014-05-10 14:43:11	localhost00	tschuy: ^^^
2014-05-10 14:43:11	frostsnow	Okay, I fiugred it out
2014-05-10 14:44:47	frostsnow	If I use ':set fileformats=unix' (Note the 's'), then vim will read-in Windows/Max files as Unix files and display the ^M. If, however, I -don't- set 'fileformats', then vim will auto-detect filetype; if the filetype has been auto-detected, I can then type ':set fileformat=unix' (note the lack of 's') and vim will convert the file to Unix format; if I've already set Unix format and it's displaying ^Ms, the command will do nothing.

2014-05-10 22:35:30	@hamper	mathuin actually meant: Does anyone here play games ?
2014-05-10 22:35:41	mathuin	I kinda meant this specific game.
2014-05-10 22:36:18	jnoah	mathuin: is 0ad on steam?
2014-05-10 22:36:43	mathuin	No, it's free and available via apt-get on Ubuntu and friends.
2014-05-10 22:37:25	jnoah	mm, corbin isn't here anymore... i think that'd be the type of game he'd play. unsure if he plays though
2014-05-10 22:37:34	mathuin	It's very Age of Empires.

2014-05-10 22:38:51	mathuin	It is totes her game, which is why I wondered if anyone here played, because it could be fun to play with others too.
2014-05-10 22:39:24	frostsnow	mathuin: Haven't played it. Is it FOSS?
2014-05-10 22:39:47	mathuin	frostsnow: I believe so, though there may be something exciting with the license that I haven't noticed.
2014-05-10 22:40:24	mathuin	Looking over the LICENSE.txt in the 0ad github repo, it's "released as open source".
2014-05-10 22:40:32	mathuin	Looks like an MIT/X11 license.
2014-05-10 22:40:51	jnoah	including the art?
2014-05-10 22:40:51	frostsnow	Hmm, yes it is. One of these days I'll get ##osu-lug-gaming going and will keep that onei n mind :P
2014-05-10 22:41:02	mathuin	The art is probably the tricky part.
2014-05-10 22:41:21	frostsnow	I Wiki'd it; it says is a Creative Commons variant (I didn't look farther than that)
2014-05-10 22:43:01	mathuin	It's a little too slow-moving to make a good Friday afternoon game at the office.

2014-05-11 17:21:14	jnoah	what does that have to do with updates?
2014-05-11 17:21:35	mythmon	not only does arch keep everything up to date, going too long without an update is a really bad idea in arch.
2014-05-11 17:21:45	jnoah	ah
2014-05-11 17:21:46	mythmon	so what i'm trying to say is that all the things are updated.

2014-05-11 17:27:46	mythmon	strace revealed nothing to me, but then i'm not very good at it.
2014-05-11 17:28:47	mythmon	i also find no evidence of video acceleration in the google-talkplugin packages.
2014-05-11 17:30:27	bkero	:(
2014-05-11 17:31:01	jnoah	bkero: it is possible that arch built it w/o vdpau/etc

2014-05-11 17:31:27	jnoah	ugh, true. damn

2014-05-11 21:24:07	mathuin	I am getting better enough at making bread that I can throw stuff together and have it work.
2014-05-11 21:24:22	mathuin	One small step for my food chemistry skills, one giant leap for my scale.
2014-05-11 21:28:19	mythmon	i should make bread
2014-05-11 21:28:29	mythmon	it's always so yummy right when it comes out.
2014-05-11 21:30:36	pwnguin	I should procure a scale and candy thermometer
2014-05-11 21:30:50	irdan	mythmon: if you're serious, you should buy this book: http://www.amazon.com/Artisan-Bread-Five-Minutes-Revolutionizes/dp/0312362919/
2014-05-11 21:31:46	mythmon	irdan: i've only ever made one bread recipe.
2014-05-11 21:31:57	irdan	then that book is perfect
2014-05-11 21:32:01	mythmon	http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Make-Bread-without-a-bread-machine/
2014-05-11 21:32:20	irdan	you take flour, yeast, salt and water and put it tuperware - mix
2014-05-11 21:32:32	irdan	then let rise for a while and cut off a peice when you want bread
2014-05-11 21:32:57	mythmon	sounds like sour dough.
2014-05-11 21:32:59	irdan	if you don't want bread right then you can put it in the fridge and it will last for a week or so
2014-05-11 21:33:10	irdan	it has a lot of instant yeast
2014-05-11 21:33:35	mythmon	ah. so not so much sour dough.
2014-05-11 21:33:38	mythmon	not for a few years at least.
2014-05-11 21:33:53	irdan	haha
2014-05-11 21:33:57	irdan	yea, not exactly
2014-05-11 21:34:08	irdan	same principles, sourdough just involves a lot more time
2014-05-11 21:34:13	irdan	and regular care/feeding
2014-05-11 21:34:19	mythmon	i know a bit about bread, i just have never decided to make more than that one recipe.
2014-05-11 21:34:24	mythmon	or sometimes that recipe with garlic
2014-05-11 21:34:53	irdan	http://carlsfriends.net/source.html
2014-05-11 21:34:58	irdan	if you want a free starter
2014-05-11 21:35:26	irdan	or rather, a starter that will cost you 2 stamps
2014-05-11 21:37:08	mythmon	that is very amusing.
2014-05-11 21:37:37	pwnguin	but you live in like mountain view, so it's like a crime against the state of california to import soughdough when you could probably just walk across the street
2014-05-11 21:38:07	mythmon	http://codon.com/programming-with-nothing AKA: writing the lambda calculus and/or church numerals in Ruby using only Procs (aka lambdas)
2014-05-11 21:38:27	mythmon	pwnguin: i think you over-estimate the urbanity of where I live.
2014-05-11 21:38:45	mythmon	also the goal is not to have sour dough, but to make sour dogugh.
2014-05-11 21:38:57	mythmon	and to learn to spell.

2014-05-11 22:06:16	mathuin	I use a starter from bread class a couple of years ago.  I can send some down with one of the students if you want.
2014-05-11 22:06:41	mathuin	I take it out once a month or so, feed it, throw some away, feed it again, take some off and bake with it, then back in the fridge.

2014-05-11 22:22:49	muricula	both, but mostly morning
2014-05-11 22:23:08	mathuin	Morning works!
2014-05-11 22:23:17	mathuin	You know how to make kombucha, right?
2014-05-11 22:23:55	muricula	Kind of, you sent me a presentation. Tea and sugar water over a warm place, scoop out the slime, right?
2014-05-11 22:24:44	mathuin	Pretty much!
2014-05-11 22:24:52	mathuin	And if you screw up, there are plenty more scobies. :-)
2014-05-11 22:25:03	muricula	thanks!

2014-05-11 22:35:16	mathuin	It was turning PDFs into paper pretty decently right up until the upgrade.

2014-05-12 22:47:10	jnoah	my box struggles with it...but the gameplay is awesome
2014-05-12 22:48:33	localhost00	muricula: That sounds like an interesting problem. If you can’t put together an SQL query to do that for you, I would just get a list of all timestamps and do some analysis.
2014-05-12 22:49:04	localhost00	There is an obvious n^2 algorithm to do what you want, but it would be interesting to see if there is an n*log(n) algorithm to do that.
2014-05-12 22:52:23	mythmon	localhost00: if it is for fixed lengths of time (3 hours), i can thing of a linear time algorithm, assuming the data is sorted.
2014-05-12 22:52:44	localhost00	How would that go?
2014-05-12 22:53:26	mythmon	put point A at the start of the list, and walk point B along the list until it is as big as it goes without passing the time limit.
2014-05-12 22:53:34	mythmon	(linear time)
2014-05-12 22:53:45	localhost00	But then don’t you have to do that for each time?
2014-05-12 22:53:50	mythmon	then count the elements in the set (linear)
2014-05-12 22:53:58	mythmon	oh. hmm
2014-05-12 22:54:11	mythmon	yeah, i guess that is probably n^2 then.
2014-05-12 22:54:33	localhost00	My knee-jerk reaction is to see if convolution could help, which could be done in n*log(n) time using the FFT.
2014-05-12 22:54:35	mythmon	you could probably do a split and merge strategy in n*log n
2014-05-12 23:01:29	nibalizer	mythmon: lets make a rap group called "split 'n merge'
2014-05-12 23:03:10	lrr	hmm... typeof says it's string, but when i do instanceof String, i get false?
2014-05-12 23:03:16	lrr	in javascript
2014-05-12 23:04:56	lrr	mythmon: i think i found out my issue
2014-05-12 23:05:13	mythmon	lrr: typeof foo === 'string' is a good way to test type in JS.
2014-05-12 23:05:20	lrr	er, not issue but challenge to discern between 'blah' and ['blah','blah']
2014-05-12 23:05:22	mythmon	a better way to deal with this is to not have that setup.
2014-05-12 23:05:41	lrr	mythmon: i'm working with node.js expressweb and i'm using req.query.<key>
2014-05-12 23:05:46	mythmon	ah
2014-05-12 23:05:53	lrr	so i don't think i can move away
2014-05-12 23:05:55	mythmon	then it should always give lists :3
2014-05-12 23:06:02	mythmon	or never give lists.
2014-05-12 23:06:03	lrr	well, i don't want lists
2014-05-12 23:06:07	lrr	lists are bad

2014-05-12 23:06:13	localhost00	Actually
2014-05-12 23:06:13	mythmon	i've implemented a couple of apis like this. i've always regretted it.
2014-05-12 23:06:46	localhost00	mythmon: Maybe the FFT can’t be used, but maybe the same method used in the FFT could also be applied.
2014-05-12 23:07:10	mythmon	localhost00: i don't know that kind of signal processing.
2014-05-12 23:07:47	lrr	mythmon: right now, if i get {email: ['blah', 'blah']}, typeof return object. if the email key only has 1 value, typeof returns string
2014-05-12 23:07:56	mythmon	lrr: it's true.
2014-05-12 23:08:03	mythmon	because JS's type system is rubbish.
2014-05-12 23:08:09	lrr	so if i do a instanceof Object, then i can force it to only be a single value for the email key
2014-05-12 23:08:18	localhost00	The FFT is based on the fact that you can express the FFT of an even-length array A in terms of the FFT of A[::2] and A[1::2]
2014-05-12 23:08:30	mythmon	lrr: i would recommend instead doing  typeof foo === 'string'

2014-05-13 08:37:47	edunham	...ow :/
2014-05-13 08:38:00	edunham	no, I didn't notice, because I stopped reading the barometer for reasons like that

2014-05-13 08:38:38	mathuin	The online version is corrected.
2014-05-13 08:38:53	mathuin	The print version was totally wrong.  The Google search results show the error.
2014-05-13 08:40:53	mathuin	They also credit Scott Kveton as "an OSU graduate who founded OSU's open-source lab" which is unfamiliar history to me.
2014-05-13 08:46:00	mythmon	edunham: bkero: I think I discovered why hangouts sucks for me.
2014-05-13 08:46:15	mythmon	I had turned of kvm support in my bios for reasons long ago.
2014-05-13 08:46:23	mythmon	those reasons were no longer valid, so I flipped it back on.
2014-05-13 08:46:30	bryon	barometer is just like 98% of all other student newspapers: mostly crap
2014-05-13 08:46:31	mythmon	and suddenly hangouts doesn't suck.
2014-05-13 08:46:42	bkero	heh, nice
2014-05-13 08:46:50	mathuin	But it's our crap. ;-)
2014-05-13 08:46:57	mythmon	so, fun fact: vidyo uses virtualization on linux.
2014-05-13 08:47:39	bkero	mythmon: what
2014-05-13 08:48:27	mythmon	bkero: well, when turning on the virtualization bits of my cpu make it work better, that is the obvious conclusion to draw.

2014-05-13 09:30:35	silentquasar	I forget what the card is at the moment. Intel something.
2014-05-13 09:33:45	silentquasar	Intel 3945ABG, using the iwl3945 driver. I'll have to look into that I guess. Thanks for the confirmation that *someone* has it working.

2014-05-13 09:51:38	rordway	most wifi clients I've seen that have problems with OSU_Secure are because of the new certificate
2014-05-13 09:52:47	jordane	'accept all certificates'... that kind of entirely defeats the point of certs
2014-05-13 09:55:20	rordway	this is true

2014-05-13 09:57:02	rordway	the other option is to add the certificate manually

2014-05-13 10:30:07	jnoah	right, but i don't think many non-tech people would know that is even possible
2014-05-13 10:30:34	chekkaa	people do it for their phones
2014-05-13 10:30:53	jnoah	phone =/= laptop
2014-05-13 10:31:08	chekkaa	it's the same principle though
2014-05-13 10:31:44	jnoah	true, that doesn't always help though :/
2014-05-13 10:32:15	chekkaa	I feel like internet connection sharing is an intuitive thing
2014-05-13 10:32:46	chekkaa	like it's one of those things that should "just work"
2014-05-13 10:33:02	rordway	checkkaa: as the family tech support guy, I can tell you that for most people it's not :)

2014-05-13 10:37:16	terrellt	Yeah, three years of helpdesk support say the majority of people, even those seriously educated, would find sharing a laptop wireless to be voodoo.
2014-05-13 10:37:50	rordway	I told him he just needed that one cable, it'll do the audio and the video
2014-05-13 10:38:03	rordway	obviously I was an idiot
2014-05-13 10:38:19	terrellt	So basically you were trying to take money from your nephew.

2014-05-13 16:38:38	drkitty	Is it one of those stupid touchpads where the button(s) are part of the touchable surface?
2014-05-13 16:39:34	drkitty	Ugh. Those are nasty.
2014-05-13 16:39:40	drkitty	I have one and it sucks under Linux.
2014-05-13 16:43:50	drkitty	I have an application that needs to store some things, like persistent API tokens and a bit of configuration. Where should that stuff be stored?
2014-05-13 16:44:06	drkitty	It already has a database so I could stuff it in there,
2014-05-13 16:44:10	drkitty	but that feels ugly to me.
2014-05-13 16:44:53	drkitty	Users don't need to see or modify any of the tokens or config.

2014-05-13 17:38:19	chance	and cause its a startup maybe i think?
2014-05-13 17:38:27	chance	not sure, they offer varying credits for different things
2014-05-13 17:38:59	chance	they just wana give you free stuff for a while until your stuck on AWS and dont want to move from it, then you have to start paying and you're already pretty engrained to AWS at that point
2014-05-13 17:39:08	terrellt	Of course.
2014-05-13 17:39:32	terrellt	We use S3 for caching CI assets, I never thought to ask for credits.

2014-05-14 16:42:05	jnoah	8 iirc
2014-05-14 16:42:13	bryon	house was 8 seasons too long
2014-05-14 16:42:17	jnoah	it should have ended at the s5 season finale

2014-05-14 16:46:15	vanrysss	Going from Android to iOS is jarring. The syntax is atrocious, but things seem so much simpler to implement.

2014-05-14 16:51:24	terrellt	vanrysss: That kind of surprises me. I would expect the nature of android would result in some pretty good abstraction tools.
2014-05-14 16:52:50	vanrysss	Android requires a lot of boilerplate, and there are different ways to do the same thing.
2014-05-14 16:52:57	vanrysss	see Fragments & Activities
2014-05-14 16:53:37	vanrysss	It's not really clear which should be used in each situation, and if you want to support deprecated versions of Android you're in for a world of confusion.
2014-05-14 16:53:54	vanrysss	I'm sure it gets easier with experience .

2014-05-14 19:34:48	mythmon	so we partnered with Adobe, who has content agreements, so we get content, and implemented in the best way we could.
2014-05-14 19:36:31	mythmon	still sad though.
2014-05-14 19:36:33	frostsnow	mythmon: I know. It is a sad day.
2014-05-14 19:36:52	mythmon	we had quite the discussion about it today, right before the announcement came out.
2014-05-14 19:39:09	frostsnow	As far as I can tell, it's possible to take an Ideological Stand, but it would likely cost Mozilla its life; pragmatically, it -does- seem the only way.
2014-05-14 19:48:04	chance	im fairly certain given the only other competitors to mozilla are all giant corps who shed no tear's about DRM technologies im not surprised
2014-05-14 19:49:05	chance	silverlight - MS, Apple already DRMs the hell out of your media with i* software/hardware, google is less bad, but still
2014-05-14 19:49:21	chance	i remember when i imported my library into itunes back in HS
2014-05-14 19:49:38	chance	and then i found out it made my music into a giant single file to prevent exporting media

2014-05-14 19:53:30	frostsnow	Yeah. Streaming technology has been very detrimental to the average person's ability to store and re-distribute content; as in, people aren't as adept at doing it now that they can stream for free most of the time.

2014-05-14 20:46:01	mythmon	jnoah: nope
2014-05-14 20:46:14	mythmon	probably a disconnect
2014-05-14 20:50:29	chance	for a simple web app should rate limiting be done by a reverse proxy or the app you think?
2014-05-14 20:51:32	mythmon	chance: what problem are you trying to solve with rate limiting?
2014-05-14 20:52:14	chance	easiest would probably be using the reverse proxy
2014-05-14 20:52:14	chance	just dont know how configurable that is.
2014-05-14 20:52:46	mythmon	i wouldn't do it there.
2014-05-14 20:53:06	mythmon	rate limiting is a really app-specific thing. don't push it to the load balancer.
2014-05-14 20:53:25	 *	mythmon isn't a fan of rate limiting as a first option.
2014-05-14 20:53:58	mythmon	we implemented it without good data. it hasn't fixed the problems, and it has hurt legitimate users.
2014-05-14 20:54:13	chance	i find that i use rotatepdf.net a lot
2014-05-14 20:54:18	chance	and it works great
2014-05-14 20:54:25	chance	but i dont imagine making a clone to be that hard
2014-05-14 20:54:30	chance	and i would like to add features
2014-05-14 20:54:52	chance	one feature being a ?fileurl=www.foobar.com type of option
2014-05-14 20:55:11	chance	where you could takea  pdf from a public url, manipulate it, and get back a link to the new one
2014-05-14 20:55:27	chance	but that would have to be ratelimited
2014-05-14 20:55:33	chance	all of it would
2014-05-14 20:55:34	mythmon	why?
2014-05-14 20:55:41	mythmon	what problem are you trying to solve?
2014-05-14 20:55:53	chance	to prevent someone from making the app download an external PDF which could be big, many many times
2014-05-14 20:56:09	mythmon	do you have evidence of that happening?
2014-05-14 20:56:17	mythmon	how will you know if your rate limit succeeded?
2014-05-14 20:56:30	mythmon	how will you measure success?
2014-05-14 20:56:42	chance	succeed is a bad way to describe that
2014-05-14 20:56:49	mythmon	i disagree
2014-05-14 20:56:50	chance	its mostly preventative
2014-05-14 20:56:58	chance	the same way i install fail2ban
2014-05-14 20:57:11	mythmon	why not instead make the system with a fair queueing algorithm?
2014-05-14 20:57:12	chance	ive never had the problem of someone bruteforcing my server via ssh
2014-05-14 20:57:21	chance	but that doesnt mean i dont prevent it
2014-05-14 20:57:24	mythmon	neither have i :)
2014-05-14 20:57:42	chance	i can also easily image a huge PDF being downloaded multiple times
2014-05-14 20:57:56	mythmon	there are so many better options to solve this perceived problem.
2014-05-14 20:58:14	chance	such as?
2014-05-14 20:58:16	chance	queuing?
2014-05-14 20:58:22	mythmon	fair queueing.
2014-05-14 20:58:29	mythmon	not first come first serve. be smarter.
2014-05-14 20:58:43	mythmon	or caching. if you get the same file twice, be smarter.
2014-05-14 20:59:07	chance	files at URLs change
2014-05-14 20:59:21	chance	so caching them would be bad
2014-05-14 20:59:26	chance	i do plan on caching hosted copies
2014-05-14 20:59:35	mythmon	luckily, the world has invented these things called cache headers.
2014-05-14 20:59:48	mythmon	and also, i wasn't suggesting doing it by url.
2014-05-14 21:00:02	mythmon	(i wasn't suggesting any particular mechanism)
2014-05-14 21:00:19	mythmon	my point is, rate limiting is the easy way out. you can do better.
2014-05-14 21:00:33	chance	so id have to assume that the otherside is caching, and that it's also able to tell when its files change?
2014-05-14 21:00:55	chance	like what if you drop a pdf into public_html
2014-05-14 21:00:59	chance	no cache in front or anything
2014-05-14 21:01:02	chance	just apache/nginx
2014-05-14 21:01:05	chance	and my app downloads it
2014-05-14 21:01:09	chance	how to cache it?
2014-05-14 21:01:13	mythmon	apache and nginx will give correct if-modified-since headers.
2014-05-14 21:01:18	mythmon	by looking at mtimes on the files.
2014-05-14 21:01:24	mythmon	drpobox will do the same.
2014-05-14 21:01:31	chance	web servers are better than i expected.
2014-05-14 21:01:47	mythmon	any random file server on the internet worth it's salt will at least not *lie* about modified times.
2014-05-14 21:01:57	chance	so i look at header, if modified, i download file ?
2014-05-14 21:02:06	chance	sounds good.
2014-05-14 21:02:12	mythmon	when you make a request, you include a 'if modified since' header
2014-05-14 21:02:18	chance	ah
2014-05-14 21:02:28	chance	store previous modified time, send in next request
2014-05-14 21:02:34	mythmon	if it was modified since then, or if the server has nfc, it will send the file.
2014-05-14 21:02:47	mythmon	if it hasn't been modified, the server sends a content not modified response, which is...
2014-05-14 21:02:48	chance	get a 'not-modified' response if its not, otherwise get the file
2014-05-14 21:02:52	mythmon	210? or something. idk.
2014-05-14 21:02:56	chance	sweet
2014-05-14 21:03:11	chance	ive been reading the PDF spec to figure out how to do some of the things i want
2014-05-14 21:03:28	chance	want to do it in Go, but library support is ehhh
2014-05-14 21:03:58	mythmon	ah, 304, sorry.
2014-05-14 21:04:09	chance	might just have to shell out
2014-05-14 21:04:10	mythmon	304 Not Modified is the response.
2014-05-14 21:04:45	mythmon	also, by the way, if you really do find out that you are over capacity, and there are simply too many legitimate requests, then i would say rate limiting is the right approach.
2014-05-14 21:05:00	mythmon	but i think that rate limiting to prevent attackers is a poor solution.
2014-05-14 21:05:19	chance	also, what concerns do i have to have if im downloading possibly arbitrary files, but not executing them, but rather opening them/writing their data elsewhere?
2014-05-14 21:05:24	mythmon	(or monetization. monetization might also be the right approach)
2014-05-14 21:05:44	mythmon	you need to make sure to not trust the filename given.
2014-05-14 21:05:52	chance	yes.
2014-05-14 21:05:59	mythmon	escape it in case it has any ../../../, or better yet, just give it a random file name.
2014-05-14 21:06:13	chance	yeah, thats what i was thinking
2014-05-14 21:06:19	mythmon	you'd have to worry about the usual resource exhaustion, memory, disk, bandwidth.
2014-05-14 21:06:28	mythmon	and any possible vulnerabilities in whatever you process the pdfs with.
2014-05-14 21:06:37	chance	oh didnt think of that
2014-05-14 21:06:46	mythmon	there might be more, but that's what i've got off the top of my head.
2014-05-14 21:07:00	chance	given the one tool ive found that seems good 'pdftk' is written in C and uses a Java library to do the stuff..that concerns me
2014-05-14 21:07:09	mythmon	but pdftk is well known.
2014-05-14 21:07:28	mythmon	whereas one written in go/rust/python/monte/javascript/whatever is less known.
2014-05-14 21:07:38	chance	yeah.
2014-05-14 21:07:44	mythmon	ooh, fun idea to avoid many abuse scenarios:
2014-05-14 21:07:51	mythmon	use pdf.js to do the rotation, and do it client side.
2014-05-14 21:07:52	chance	i just suppose most people dont throw malicious PDFs at pdftk though
2014-05-14 21:08:01	mythmon	just down the file and re-upload it to the user, and do it client side.
2014-05-14 21:08:11	chance	at first i dont really want a clientside
2014-05-14 21:08:12	chance	at all
2014-05-14 21:08:17	mythmon	sure
2014-05-14 21:08:20	mythmon	just an idea.
2014-05-14 21:08:30	chance	yeah. i was looking at pdf.js for things though
2014-05-14 21:08:44	chance	mostly an easy way to render things for people if i added a frontend
2014-05-14 21:08:51	mythmon	i know almost nothing about pdf.js. i just think it's neat.
2014-05-14 21:08:56	chance	me too
2014-05-14 21:11:09	chance	it will be interesting, ive never done file upload/downloads in any web apps ive written thus far
2014-05-14 21:11:14	mythmon	also, if it turns out rotating pdfs is slow, and you get lots of repeats,you could hash the pdfs and cache by that too.
2014-05-14 21:11:36	chance	i thought about hashing
2014-05-14 21:11:45	chance	i could do that for existing copies
2014-05-14 21:12:01	mythmon	it might be faster just to rotate it.
