2014-05-28 15:51:50	pp4el	i thought tc was the gold standard
2014-05-28 15:51:50	reanimus	RubyPanther: basically; if you don’t trust the other person, all bets are off. up until now we’ve implicitly trusted the TC devs (scary, eh?)
2014-05-28 15:51:50	schneier	no
2014-05-28 15:51:53	multi_io	mg^^: yeah, I'd go with "use everything at once" 8-D
2014-05-28 15:51:55	localh0t	best option to do if you compiled the "trusty" truecrypt-7.1a from your computer is to stay like that and not open the volume for days until we better know what's happening
2014-05-28 15:51:56	schneier	pp4el: no
2014-05-28 15:52:04	vanila	nell, I'm sorry? What?
2014-05-28 15:52:08	jan64	by unsupported, do you mean tools with community that founded costly crypto audit recently? :>

2014-05-28 15:54:14	SteveG	I don't think a gov would pressure for a backdoor since it is an open source project.  Too likely to be discovered.

2014-05-28 15:54:33	[mbm]	atg_: so what you're saying is that a prime target used truecrypt and now the government is after the truecrypt authors and this was placed as some sort of canary?
2014-05-28 15:54:37	RubyPanther	crowell: It is the difference between real-world concerns and theoretical philosophical concerns

2014-05-28 15:54:58	SteveG	But, a gov might want it shut down since it is arguably the most ubiquitous open source crypto out there and they'd rather people not be using it.

2014-05-28 15:55:23	RubyPanther	I never fell for the idea that encryption could protect me from society, I only bought into the idea that it protected my data from certain types of direct assault
2014-05-28 15:55:24	SteveG	storge: or whiskey ;-)
2014-05-28 15:55:24	Darky	stasiek: we probably won't get any dev answer for a while
2014-05-28 15:55:24	atg_	[mbm]: I think that the government tried to pressure the devs in putting a backdoor
2014-05-28 15:55:28	nell	Yeap. Time to order chinese.
2014-05-28 15:55:33	atg_	but the devs shut it down instead
2014-05-28 15:55:41	terabit	you mean to tell me they can put a backdoor in openssl but not in truecrypt ? lol
2014-05-28 15:55:43	coolbot95	I still feel annoyed by the fact that the Bitcoin developers are NOT anonymous. I mean, any of the core developers could be compromised by a home visit and made to add in malware.
2014-05-28 15:55:44	soot	schneier: few people are qualified to audit TC
2014-05-28 15:55:46	atg_	unfortunately, they are under a secret gag order like lavabit
2014-05-28 15:55:51	[mbm]	atg_: that's possible
2014-05-28 15:55:55	cirrus]	atg_, and they'd recommend a BitLocker? really?
2014-05-28 15:56:01	terabit	atg_: already there already was one and they just found out
2014-05-28 15:56:06	RubyPanther	terabit: I guess "open" sounds less secure than "true"
2014-05-28 15:56:15	jan64	schneier, are you Matt Joyce, by any chance?
2014-05-28 15:56:19	soot	I'd rather trust a service over a binary. I've seen enough obfuscated C submissions to realize that you can do creative stuff. Now give the NSA who has the top grads in the nation and my paranoia level goes off the charts.
2014-05-28 15:56:22	[mbm]	cirrus]: maybe the bitlocker recommendation was the way of hinting that they were forced
2014-05-28 15:56:22	coolbot95	WideOpenCrypt.
2014-05-28 15:56:23	truecrypt-dev	Look at the qording.  It MAY have security issues
2014-05-28 15:56:31	HD|Laptop	cirrus]: if you're not allowed to disclose "there is a bug" then this is a creative way of evasion
2014-05-28 15:56:34	RubyPanther	"open" is like an open door, a crypt is like, a safe place to spend thousands of years
2014-05-28 15:56:51	coolbot95	soot: You'd rather trust a service? What do you mean?
2014-05-28 15:56:54	schneier	jan64: nope
2014-05-28 15:57:03	jan64	damn
2014-05-28 15:57:03	schneier	soot: I'm well aware
2014-05-28 15:57:17	schneier	those same people are also qualified to audit bitlocker
2014-05-28 15:57:20	RubyPanther	It is guaranteed to have "security issues," even the perception of problems is an Issue.

2014-05-28 16:37:02	ValdikSS	Providing some details from SourceForge:
2014-05-28 16:37:03	ValdikSS	1. We have had no contact with the TrueCrypt project team (and thus no complaints).
2014-05-28 16:37:05	ValdikSS	2. We see no indicator of account compromise; current usage is consistent with past usage.
2014-05-28 16:37:06	ValdikSS	3. Our recent SourceForge forced password change was triggered by infrastructure improvements not a compromise. FMI see http://sourceforge.net/blog/forced-password-change/
2014-05-28 16:37:06	Andorin	oh lol
