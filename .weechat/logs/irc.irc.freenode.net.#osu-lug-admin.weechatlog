2014-05-19 09:16:53	edunham	speaking of which, could you confirm with lawyer that date still works etc.?

2014-05-19 09:37:03	frostsnow	edunham: Confirmed
2014-05-19 14:46:38	edunham	okay, jordane cannot do talk tomorrow because family medical things
2014-05-19 14:47:01	edunham	our options are 1) have me do my 0 to merging/rebasing in an hour talk
2014-05-19 14:47:19	edunham	or 2) have somebody (possibly me) grab Jordan's slides and talk on git plumbing
2014-05-19 14:47:37	edunham	chekkaa, deanj, MaraJade, muricula thoughts?
2014-05-19 14:57:51	@chekkaa	idk what git plumbing is
2014-05-19 14:58:05	edunham	internals
2014-05-19 14:58:08	edunham	advanced git stuff
2014-05-19 14:58:23	@chekkaa	internals?
2014-05-19 14:58:29	@chekkaa	like the algorithms it uses?
2014-05-19 14:58:36	frostsnow	chekkaa: In contrast to "porcelain", which are the command-line tools "git (add|commit|merge)" which you usually use
2014-05-19 14:58:58	@chekkaa	so APIs?
2014-05-19 14:59:03	frostsnow	chekkaa: Lower-level tools for operating on git objects. I read about them a little bit but it went mostly over my head :P
2014-05-19 14:59:19	@chekkaa	that's way over my head
2014-05-19 14:59:24	@chekkaa	git is magic
2014-05-19 15:03:24	akeym	is it really helpful to know that stuff?
2014-05-19 15:04:11	edunham	it was a requested talk
2014-05-19 15:04:34	akeym	well, i'm not questioning that
2014-05-19 15:05:00	frostsnow	It could be useful if you need to make custom git things, or perhaps is something does wrong with a git repo. I'd imagine that the first option would be -much- closer to what the average LUG attendee could grok, though.
2014-05-19 15:05:08	frostsnow	goes wrong*
2014-05-19 15:05:22	akeym	i'm just curious "in what way would I benefit from this; who's the target audience"
2014-05-19 15:06:15	edunham	uhh it was a requested talk?
2014-05-19 15:06:18	edunham	"advanced git"
2014-05-19 15:06:47	frostsnow	I'd think it's a deep enough subject that edunham would be better off giving her talk rather than reading an advanced topic from jordane's slides... but I'm also not going to be attending so I'm not officially voting
2014-05-19 16:39:57	muricula	edunham: can I get a link to his slides? I'd probably just have you do your git basics talk then
2014-05-19 16:40:20	edunham	muricula: https://github.com/jordane/git-talk-slides/blob/master/index.html#L188
2014-05-19 16:47:47	muricula	edunham: how do I tell github to just serve that content to me? Reading html is kind of a pain when you really just care about the content
2014-05-19 16:48:17	edunham	https://rawgit.com/jordane/git-talk-slides/master/index.html#/introduction
2014-05-19 16:57:30	 *	muricula is not qualified to give that talk
2014-05-19 16:58:52	 *	edunham could do it

2014-05-27 11:46:40	@jnoah	for me, they are unneeded. we already have labels, and hey, maybe i want to see that stuff right when i open gmail rather than clicking everywhere to find it
2014-05-27 11:47:21	@jnoah	more clicks does not a better UI make

2014-06-27 10:14:16	edunham	okay admins and folks with hats, it's been pointed out that offensive remarks were being made in channel yesterday evening while i was offline
2014-06-27 10:16:34	@jnoah	oh? I think I missed this too
2014-06-27 10:16:42	edunham	if anyone with a hat catches such remarks being made at the time (before conversation has moved on), please kick the offender with a calm and polite message explaining what behavior violates which freenode policy and linking to http://freenode.net/policy.shtml
2014-06-27 10:17:12	edunham	well actually best policy is to ping the person in PM first explaining that the remark wasn't acceptable
2014-06-27 10:17:49	edunham	if hate speech etc. results from such a correction, pastebin the logs and drop the link here and... yeah.. things or something
2014-06-27 11:00:35	bryon	uh oh, was it me? i think i might have let an f-bomb fly before realizing what channel i was in.
2014-06-27 11:02:57	edunham	no.
2014-06-27 11:03:04	bryon	ok whew
2014-06-27 11:03:30	bryon	i let slip a "f*#$ off and die"
2014-06-27 11:03:52	bryon	then was like, "That sounds like something alice would say"
2014-06-27 11:03:55	bryon	then i shut up
2014-06-27 11:04:59	shirgan	bryon: I saw that and thought it wasn't horribly out-of-line
2014-06-27 11:05:18	shirgan	Like, it wasn't rude towards someone in the channel
2014-06-27 11:05:40	bryon	true
2014-06-27 11:05:42	shirgan	Avoiding swears is good but it wasn't the end of the world
2014-06-27 11:05:48	bryon	it was very  much in-context for the convo
2014-06-27 11:05:55	shirgan	Right
2014-06-27 11:06:00	edunham	yeah saying a person should vs saying a tool should
2014-06-27 11:06:08	edunham	generally direct, harrassing language to individuals or groups
2014-06-27 11:06:57	edunham	bryon: also your description of it resembling another person's usual remarks is, although true, also kinda harrassing/needlessly specific and critical
2014-06-27 11:07:05	edunham	so please don't phrase things that way
2014-06-27 11:07:14	bryon	sure
2014-06-27 11:07:34	bryon	i get that
2014-06-27 11:10:42	edunham	ok, thanks.
2014-06-27 11:12:33	@jnoah	edunham: does something need to be done? Or has this issue been taken care of?
2014-06-27 11:13:04	edunham	jnoah: read backscroll. I have specified what action I think it'd be best for ops to take *during* incidents if they occur
2014-06-27 11:13:13	edunham	I think that after things are over it's least disruptive to just ignore it
2014-06-27 11:13:32	edunham	so action will need to be taken while things are occurring, if they occur in channel, but otherwise nothing needed.
2014-06-27 11:14:56	mathuin	edunham: it is probably best after the fact to publicly ignore it but privately address the issue with the "offender".  This will allow you to respond to the "offended" if they are under the impression that nothing has been done to address the issue, without publicly reraising the stink.
2014-06-27 11:14:56	deanj	I disagree. I think telling them that there were complaints and referring them to our policies/freenode policies is the correct action to take. Obviously not kicking or whatever this late in to the conflict, but definitely talking with the person about it.
2014-06-27 11:15:14	@jnoah	Even if it's late, I think at least a PM with logs should be sent.
2014-06-27 11:15:23	deanj	haha, mathuin and I said about the same thing at the same second.
2014-06-27 11:16:01	mathuin	As long as the offended can be reassured that stuff is being handled, we're fine.
2014-06-27 11:16:48	mathuin	Well, you are.  I'm just this guy. :-)
2014-06-27 11:17:09	edunham	mathuin: you're just this guy with like a master's degree in how to open source humans.
2014-06-27 11:17:17	deanj	mathuin++
2014-06-27 11:17:27	mathuin	Aww, shucks. ;-)
