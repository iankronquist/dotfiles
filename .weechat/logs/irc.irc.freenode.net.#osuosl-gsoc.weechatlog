2014-05-27 13:33:33	pono	muricula: emaadmanzoor is working on a Python IPMI client with a REST API.
2014-05-27 13:33:50	pono	I don't know how far you are on the SNMP project, but kennric thinks we should work out a common interface for both.
2014-05-27 13:33:50	muricula	awesome
2014-05-27 13:34:14	pono	Is your code on your github?
2014-05-27 13:34:42	muricula	Okay, we're finishing the design phase right now. The code is not yet on github, but let me pastebin a copy of our working design document
2014-05-27 13:35:29	muricula	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/7511/
2014-05-27 13:36:00	pono	Great. Here is a link to what emaadmanzoor has so far, https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/igor-rest-api
2014-05-27 13:37:22	pono	muricula: Let me take a look and see how we can integrate both into a single design.

2014-05-27 13:47:50	pono	kennric: So it sounds like muricula isn't at the interface side of things yet, so that will allow emaadmanzoor to be more flexible in his design so long as we can incorporate what we need for the SNMP side of things.
2014-05-27 13:49:17	kennric	pono: yeah - the key thing is to build it modular enough that we can plug in functionality on the back end
2014-05-27 13:49:57	pono	Okay, I'll keep that in mind as we move forward.
2014-05-27 13:50:05	kennric	he is workign primarily on an snmp function library that will do what we need, the front end to come later (but we really want a json api)
2014-05-27 13:51:27	kennric	so, function libraryw ith python api, plus daemon/server component that talks to the library and exposes json api for web/curses/etc front ends
2014-05-27 13:54:52	pono	We can build the interface seperately so that we can have the SNMP library plug into it.
2014-05-27 13:56:05	kennric	right - ideally, the front-ends talk http/json back to the api layer, and the api layer imports functionality from the libraries
2014-05-27 13:56:21	kennric	so we can easily tack on a web interface later
2014-05-27 13:56:32	pono	Cool, that should totally be within the scope of the project.

I have some designs scribbles here: http://eyeshalfclosed.com/osuosl/ Your design doc is way more comprehensive so I'll use the same structure for my own!
2014-05-28 04:31:07	emaadmanzoor	I'd been working on some implementation details. I'm going to switch back from REST/authentication/database implementation today and spend time on having a concrete design.

2014-05-28 15:33:43	pmittal	My sleep times are very irregular. I'll have to fix that. :p
2014-05-28 15:35:04	pmittal	kennric: yes, I would need some sort of rsync config validator. Isn't there one that exists already?
2014-05-28 15:37:44	kennric	As Ramereth said, rsync should return 1 on a config error, can you test that?
2014-05-28 15:38:01	kennric	17:50 < Ramereth> but for the permission problem, that's not a runtime config test
2014-05-28 15:38:04	kennric	17:50 < Ramereth> the app would need to ensure the rsync password file is the correct permissions
2014-05-28 15:38:51	Ramereth	kennric: well, i realized if you set RSYNC_PASSWORD in the env you can bypass that

2014-05-28 15:44:25	pmittal	Ramereth: RSYNC_PASSWORD is used by the rsync client right?.. we are talking about rsync in daemon mode
2014-05-28 15:45:08	pmittal	Didn't understand what gets bypassed.
2014-05-28 15:45:10	pmittal	?
2014-05-28 15:46:17	Ramereth	why would we be using a password on the deamon?
2014-05-28 15:47:50	pmittal	For access control; but that's set via rsyncd.secrets file not the env variable RSYNC_PASSWORD?
2014-05-28 15:49:37	pmittal	oh, I get it. You mean the prompt for a password is bypassed if we use the RSYNC_PASSWORD.
2014-05-28 15:49:49	pmittal	(sorry I misunderstood, earlier)
2014-05-28 15:51:43	pmittal	I am working on the stuff we discussed in the email yesterday.
2014-05-28 15:51:49	pmittal	Have implemented the rsync_options feature already.
2014-05-28 15:51:57	pmittal	https://github.com/pramttl/mirror-sync-api/issues/11
2014-05-28 15:53:24	pmittal	Details added to README in "Adding a project" section.
2014-05-28 15:53:58	pmittal	rsync_options is a list of strings like ['-avH','--delete',..] containing rsync args.
2014-05-28 15:55:05	pmittal	..passed along as a parameter in the json POSTed to /add_project/
2014-05-28 15:56:32	pmittal	I am not sure if something special needs to be done for --delete options? (Point. 5 in email)
2014-05-28 15:56:37	pmittal	Ramereth: ^
2014-05-28 15:57:18	pmittal	I mean we can simply set rsync_options list to contain '--delete-after' instead of '--delete'.
2014-05-28 16:02:05	Ramereth	pmittal: I think delete is special in the case of this app
2014-05-28 16:02:31	Ramereth	and should be represented as its on parameter. If you would like I can comment on its various states in the issue
2014-05-28 16:02:57	pmittal	Ramereth: Sure!
2014-05-28 16:23:36	pmittal	One possible advantage of introducing something like an rsync_delete_option parameter separately, (instead of simply defining it in rsync_options) is that it could allow us to keep '--delete' as a default without having to specify it in most cases.
2014-05-28 16:23:52	pmittal	And I am quite surprised to see the number of delete option states (7).
2014-05-28 16:23:54	Ramereth	exactly what I was thinking

2014-06-03 14:09:24	pmittal	kennric, chance: Hey!
2014-06-03 14:09:26	pmittal	I guess its better to use `socket.getfqdn()` rather than `socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())` to determine the IP address or hostname of a node. What's your suggestion?
2014-06-03 14:10:23	kennric	pmittal: I actually have not used either of those, so I am not sure
2014-06-03 14:10:23	pmittal	In my case I am trying to determine IP address on the master node which gets passed to ftp_host (slave node)
2014-06-03 14:11:23	pmittal	Oh, who might help me on this?
2014-06-03 14:11:57	pmittal	I saw it in ganeti too somewhere.
2014-06-03 14:12:03	pmittal	(in the code)
2014-06-03 14:14:03	pmittal	Right now I am trying to implement the master node api (for FTP mirror syncing) When the master node syncs from the upstream source,
2014-06-03 14:14:21	pmittal	It has to tell the slave nodes to sync from itself. (master)
2014-06-03 14:14:43	pmittal	So basically master node has to tell the slave nodes its IP address
2014-06-03 14:14:53	pmittal	which does not have to be "127.0.0.1"
2014-06-03 14:15:02	pmittal	(for obvious reasons) :p
2014-06-03 14:17:16	pmittal	And not even "localhost" for that matter. It has to be the external IP address of the master.
2014-06-03 14:17:50	pmittal	Trying to figure out how we can get that IP address / external hostname using python.
2014-06-03 14:18:40	chance	why does the master node need to tell other nodes it's IP?
2014-06-03 14:18:55	chance	i would think you just configure the other nodes with the IP of the master
2014-06-03 14:19:07	kennric	hmm, I think the fqd function will do that, but like I said, I am not sure, you'll have to do some research
2014-06-03 14:19:08	chance	and then i would assume they just look at their settings
2014-06-03 14:22:33	pmittal	chance: That's a fine idea too; I was thinking if we can avoid this additional configuration step.
2014-06-03 14:25:21	pmittal	kennric: yes, I think fqdn one seems to be the better option. Fqd's can be adjusted by editing /etc/hosts.
2014-06-03 14:26:11	pmittal	But if we have to edit /etc/hosts then we can have a configuration step anyway.

2014-06-05 10:24:51	emaadmanzoor	pono: It's going well, I wrapped up the database migration part today. So now it creates an sqlite3 database and populates it if it doesn't exist already.
2014-06-05 10:25:04	emaadmanzoor	So it should be easy to git clone and try it out now
2014-06-05 10:25:54	pono	Great, I'll give it a try now
2014-06-05 10:26:36	emaadmanzoor	Before June 9 the goal is to (1) Complete the machine credentials part; you can grant each user access to particular machines. So this is a user_id-machine_id table. (2) Complete the CLI command that power cycles a machine.
2014-06-05 10:27:21	pono	That sounds like a resonable goal from where you are at now.  Keep up the good work!
2014-06-05 10:27:24	emaadmanzoor	I'm not sure how exactly the current users of OSL machines authenticate themselves, so once I have a test machine I'll need a day or two to make sure everything works well.
2014-06-05 10:27:32	emaadmanzoor	Thanks!
2014-06-05 10:28:34	pono	Just set up the new code and it runs as expected
2014-06-05 10:28:42	emaadmanzoor	https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/igor-rest-api/blob/master/docs/EXAMPLES.md
2014-06-05 10:28:49	emaadmanzoor	This page has some examples of the current API

2014-06-05 11:50:17	s1991	kennric: hi, its working fine. I almost done upgrading to 1.4, once I proper get project upgrade to 1.4 it'll be more easy further since major changes were done from 1.3 to 1.4
2014-06-05 11:51:45	kennric	where are you checkign in your changes?
2014-06-05 11:52:09	kennric	when you have 1.4, we should test it out on our staging servers
2014-06-05 11:52:52	s1991	I'm checking out django's official release note
2014-06-05 11:53:40	kennric	are you pushing your changes to your own github repo?
2014-06-05 11:54:37	s1991	kennric: I though I would push when I'm done with 1.4
2014-06-05 11:54:52	s1991	but no worries, I'll do it by today
2014-06-05 11:55:35	kennric	it's a good idea to commit changes as you go, at least to a testing branch, in case you need to go back - but when you have the 1.4 work done, we'll want to clone your changes for testing
2014-06-05 11:56:32	s1991	kennric: sure, I'll do it soon.

2014-06-05 16:35:45	s1991	because {{count}} is able to take value in 1
2014-06-05 16:35:53	kennric	possibly inherited from the search form template?

2014-06-06 14:25:33	kennric	is there a good reason to change them?
2014-06-06 14:27:22	s1991	yes, in django>=1.4 session variable are not deleted automatically I've to "del request.session['search']" so that in templates {% if request.session.search %} becomes false whenever needed
2014-06-06 14:28:19	kennric	sounds like a good reason to me. The methods will be trivial, and I think pointing urls to methods rather than templates is more standard anyway

2014-06-10 11:04:24	pmittal	In the mirror syncing project,  I just completed an important portion of the Master-Slave node interfacing today; this means that after the master node pulls the data from upstream it asks all the slave nodes to pull the data from it as well. (ie. 2 level syncing Upstream -> Master -> Slave Node is now possible with the api)
2014-06-10 11:07:06	kennric	pmittal: great! do you have a set of vms or other way to test the functionality?
2014-06-10 11:08:05	pmittal	I have one aws instance where I have setup an rsync daemon
2014-06-10 11:08:26	pmittal	That acts an upstream source for my testing purposes.
2014-06-10 11:08:56	pmittal	I use my laptop as the master node as well as the slave node with the each of the master api and slave api running on different ports.
2014-06-10 11:09:10	kennric	is all your code checked into github?
2014-06-10 11:09:35	pmittal	yes it is, over here -> https://github.com/pramttl/mirror-sync-api
2014-06-10 11:10:17	kennric	I'll take a look at that later today. What is the next major feature you plan to work on?
2014-06-10 11:12:36	pmittal	I have to yet to change the parameter names as I discussed with Ramereth last week, which I will be do soon.
2014-06-10 11:12:40	pmittal	... and the rsync default options.
2014-06-10 11:12:50	pmittal	I am adding whatever feature ideas and issues on priority to github issues.
2014-06-10 11:12:57	pmittal	https://github.com/pramttl/mirror-sync-api/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open
2014-06-10 11:13:16	pmittal	It might be a good idea to test the code with multiple vm's
2014-06-10 11:13:35	kennric	yes, we need to do that, I think we can set something up here for testing
2014-06-10 11:13:56	pmittal	okay, that would be great.
2014-06-10 11:14:24	pmittal	* will be doing soon (typo)
2014-06-10 11:16:28	pmittal	I'll just write the steps to use the API here in a nutshell.
2014-06-10 11:16:48	pmittal	- First we run master API on the master node
2014-06-10 11:16:51	pmittal	- Then we run slave api on slave node
2014-06-10 11:17:13	pmittal	- Add slave (objects) via the master API (since Master node should be aware of the slave IP's) (*compare with Ganeti)
2014-06-10 11:17:40	pmittal	- Carry API operations, add upstream project references, modify, remove, etc (via master api)
2014-06-10 11:18:45	pmittal	- Projects are synced from upstream to master as scheduled and immediately after that each of the slave nodes in the cluster are instructed to sync the projects from the master node.
2014-06-10 11:20:26	pmittal	- 2 level sync is hence completed. There is minimal editing of configuration files and most operations are performed via api calls. The basic settings are specified in settings.py file in the root directory of the project.
2014-06-10 11:20:51	kennric	so you aren't using a database at this point, are you?
2014-06-10 11:20:54	kennric	just config files?
2014-06-10 11:21:47	pmittal	no, sqlite db is being used.
2014-06-10 11:22:01	pmittal	Infact conig files are not being used.
2014-06-10 11:22:15	pmittal	Only a few setting are specified in settings.py
2014-06-10 11:22:25	kennric	oh, I see, you meant config files for the api code
2014-06-10 11:22:27	kennric	got it
2014-06-10 11:24:35	pmittal	yeah, like django settings.
2014-06-10 11:24:38	pmittal	https://github.com/pramttl/mirror-sync-api/blob/develop/settings.py
2014-06-10 11:24:51	pmittal	^ you can see that only a few parameters are defined here.
2014-06-10 11:25:04	pmittal	Most of them are added dynamically via the API.
2014-06-10 11:26:14	pmittal	I would need to improve the docs a lot to make it easy to understand. :)
2014-06-10 11:26:33	pmittal	All of it is in the README at the moment.
2014-06-10 11:27:20	kennric	yes, it's a good idea to start a docs directory and start creating sphinx docs as soon as you can, so you don't have to do it all at the end

2014-06-11 11:49:31	pmittal	Are the same rsync_options to be used for syncing between master-slave as used for the upstream-master syncing?
2014-06-11 11:49:41	Ramereth	in theory, yes

2014-06-12 10:57:52	emaadmanzoor	 pono: Hey! I'm close to done with the REST API and initial CLI. For the next steps in having the serial-on-LAN console or power-cycling working, I'll need access to a machine to test things.
2014-06-12 11:00:21	pono	emaadmanzoor: Great, let me go make sure we have a machine to test with.
2014-06-12 11:01:31	emaadmanzoor	pono: Cool!
2014-06-12 11:08:33	pono	emaadmanzoor: it will take a day or two to get it networked.  What's next in the design stage that could be worked on in the meantime?
2014-06-12 11:09:29	emaadmanzoor	pono: Ok I will need to complete the machine-user permissions
2014-06-12 11:10:06	emaadmanzoor	pono: I could start with the web interface. It only depends on the REST API.
2014-06-12 11:11:11	pono	Did you want to have a curses interface before the web UI?
2014-06-12 11:11:42	emaadmanzoor	pono: Sure! I was unsure if that is more important, since there would already be a CLI.
2014-06-12 11:11:51	emaadmanzoor	pono: So we'd have 2 things that run off the command-line
2014-06-12 11:12:34	pono	The rest api is nice, but curl is a bit cumbersome to to interact with.
2014-06-12 11:12:42	emaadmanzoor	Right
2014-06-12 11:12:49	emaadmanzoor	The CLI will wrap these curl commands
2014-06-12 11:13:01	emaadmanzoor	So you'd just do something like "igor login", "igor osl01 power on"
2014-06-12 11:13:14	pono	Yeah!
2014-06-12 11:13:24	emaadmanzoor	The curses UI will do the same thing though, but with a UI
2014-06-12 11:14:43	emaadmanzoor	The web UI will put some pressure on the REST API design in a different way, so it'll be better for us to figure out if anything is wrong in the current design.
2014-06-12 11:15:55	emaadmanzoor	Also about security, I don't have a background in this except for the standard practices (eg. avoid plaintext password).
2014-06-12 11:16:03	emaadmanzoor	Will this be used from outside the OSL network?
2014-06-12 11:17:39	pono	Eventually I think we might expose it.  But for now we will limit the access to our own network.
2014-06-12 11:17:51	emaadmanzoor	Hmm alright
2014-06-12 11:18:18	emaadmanzoor	Maybe I should spend some time reading up on this and checking our API at a later stage, once everything is done
2014-06-12 11:19:22	pono	I see what you are saying about the web UI putting pressure on the API, so maybe that will be a good place to start.
2014-06-12 11:19:38	pono	But in either case, reading up on HTTPS and Flask would be a good idea.
2014-06-12 11:20:10	emaadmanzoor	Alright, cool!
2014-06-12 11:20:20	emaadmanzoor	So I'll run a design for that by you after the weekend
2014-06-12 11:21:09	pono	Great.

2014-06-13 11:33:02	s1991	hello, I want to know does pgd in its database has table named 'osuosl.registration_registrationprofile', because its not specified in models
2014-06-13 11:33:50	kennric	hmm, that sounds like part of the built-in django admin middleware
2014-06-13 11:35:06	s1991	but even built-in django admin creates some table automatically by running 'syncdb'
2014-06-13 11:35:45	kennric	right - so you are seeing the table in the db, or not seeing it?
2014-06-13 11:36:47	s1991	no, I don't see it
2014-06-13 11:37:24	kennric	hmm, looking
2014-06-13 11:39:53	mathuin	We don't use registration right now.
2014-06-13 11:39:54	kennric	I don't know yet, I'll need to go look at the real db, but osuosl is not a module in the pgd project
2014-06-13 11:40:08	mathuin	It was broken when I started, and nobody complained since then. :-)
2014-06-13 11:45:13	s1991	but since I was upgrading so I thought to check it out once

2014-06-18 10:39:12	mathuin	s1991: I'm having trouble testing v1.4 due to a bug that the Django folks have declined to fix.
2014-06-18 10:39:54	s1991	mathuin: what kind of trouble
2014-06-18 10:40:13	mathuin	"Broken pipe" when run with runserver.
2014-06-18 10:40:25	mathuin	How's your progress on v1.6?  The Django folks say it's fixed in 1.6
2014-06-18 10:41:36	s1991	mathuin: ya, that is due to browser I guess, I also had that but I confirmed it on #Django
2014-06-18 10:41:48	mathuin	Okay.
2014-06-18 10:41:52	s1991	mathuin: ya, I didn't got that in 1.6
2014-06-18 10:42:19	mathuin	Awesome.
2014-06-18 10:42:43	s1991	I'm just facing 1 probm, the once I told. But let me check it once more, by today, I'll push it
2014-06-18 10:42:52	s1991	the one*
2014-06-18 10:42:55	mathuin	Thank you!  I would very much like to test it. ;-)
2014-06-18 10:43:06	s1991	ok
2014-06-18 11:58:40	mathuin	Okay!  Making progress!  I can almost do a search. :-)
2014-06-18 11:58:56	mathuin	Historically we blurred the lines between media and static, that's my last remaining issue.
2014-06-18 11:59:05	mathuin	I think. :-)
2014-06-18 12:06:56	s1991	mathuin: because in v1.4+ MEDIA_URL and STATIC_URL needs to have a trailing
2014-06-18 12:07:39	mathuin	No, I mean that we stored our static files in the media directory because they weren't really separate, and we don't really upload stuff like that.
2014-06-18 12:08:47	mathuin	I have a 15-min process that uses vagrant to build a virtual machine and install everything we need from our specific version of Python to the branch of the PGD.  If this finishes and I can do a search with your code, I think we'll be very confident it all works. :-)
2014-06-18 12:08:56	s1991	but we are not using STATIC_URL anywhere
2014-06-18 12:09:24	mathuin	Right, because we predate the separation -- we go back to the old days when it was all in media.
2014-06-18 12:10:45	s1991	I guess still it's all in media except I change the url only
2014-06-18 12:18:08	mathuin	Right.
2014-06-18 12:18:23	mathuin	I started writing my framework using the new world as a model, which had separate static and media. :-)
2014-06-18 12:18:37	mathuin	We'll see what happens when it finishes the latest rebuild.
2014-06-18 12:20:21	s1991	ok, I'm waiting
2014-06-18 12:35:25	mathuin	Yeah, I transposed static and media so I have to tinker a tiny bit more.  My wife is waiting for me so I have to go to lunch.  See you in an hour or so!
2014-06-18 12:38:25	s1991	ok
2014-06-18 13:20:24	s1991	I'm getting no help for pyAMF thing...
2014-06-18 13:25:06	kennric	pyAMF?
2014-06-18 13:31:08	s1991	kennric: in PGD project there's a script in pgd.pgd_search.tester.py which uses pyamf module, running which give me some error
2014-06-18 13:32:06	kennric	what was the error?
2014-06-18 13:33:50	s1991	kennric: http://pastebin.com/Ehpr0fCd
2014-06-18 13:35:11	s1991	I don't know what does that script actually do, or our project use it or not
2014-06-18 13:35:49	kennric	it is for supporting a flash interface, as far as I know we are not using flash for anything, but mathuin would know better
2014-06-18 13:37:02	s1991	ya, ok
2014-06-18 13:37:53	mathuin	I think it is safe to ignore that script.
2014-06-18 13:39:21	s1991	what about 1.4, are you done testing
2014-06-18 13:39:35	mathuin	Not yet -- just got back when I saw your messages with kennric.
2014-06-18 13:40:14	s1991	ok, if I can ignore that, than I'm done with 1.6
2014-06-18 13:41:05	mathuin	Push it to the branch?
2014-06-18 13:42:02	s1991	now, doing
2014-06-18 13:42:29	mathuin	Awesome.  What's next on your midterm goals?
2014-06-18 13:44:51	mathuin	Looks like your'e well on your way!
2014-06-18 13:46:45	s1991	ya, now master is v1.6
2014-06-18 13:47:28	s1991	ya, since 1 week left, I guess we can consider upgrading python as well, if that doesn't take too much time
2014-06-18 13:51:04	mathuin	Let's make sure that the v1.6 works both front-end (actually searching) and back-end (working with the database).
2014-06-18 13:51:42	s1991	ok
2014-06-18 13:53:24	mathuin	Until we finish testing, you can work on documenting the changes you've made as well as stuff you've noticed that future developers might want to know.
2014-06-18 13:59:58	s1991	fine

2014-06-18 17:13:20	mathuin	I'm loading all the relevant javascript and all.

2014-06-19 15:45:30	pono	I do
2014-06-19 15:45:36	emaadmanzoor	I think it may be due to the update-resolv.conf

2014-06-19 15:47:37	emaadmanzoor	ok
2014-06-19 15:47:49	emaadmanzoor	Do you have a sample command I can test with?
2014-06-19 15:47:56	pono	Hah, yeah usually there is a lot more debugging
2014-06-19 15:48:02	emaadmanzoor	Yeah!
2014-06-19 15:48:58	emaadmanzoor	The gateway needs to be changed here: http://wiki.osuosl.org/supercell/supercell_vpn.html
2014-06-19 15:49:07	emaadmanzoor	From funnel.osuosl.org to vpn.osuosl.org

2014-06-19 15:51:45	emaadmanzoor	Awesome, ipmitool works
2014-06-19 15:51:56	emaadmanzoor	I'm able to look at the chassis status

2014-06-21 11:58:00	emaadmanzoor	Will everything come back up as it should?
2014-06-21 11:58:08	pono	Yes!  It's there for your work.
2014-06-21 11:58:14	emaadmanzoor	Cool :-)
2014-06-21 11:58:19	pono	There shouldn't be a problem with it coming back.
2014-06-21 11:58:25	emaadmanzoor	I was afraid of losing access to the machine

2014-06-23 15:44:49	emaadmanzoor	pono: Hey! I've been working on the CLI.
2014-06-23 15:45:33	emaadmanzoor	I spent some time finding a nice framework to use, I started with docopt which uses your CLI docs to build a parser, but it was too limited.
2014-06-23 15:45:56	emaadmanzoor	So now I'm using click, and it's going well.
2014-06-23 15:46:04	pono	Oh I've heard about click.
2014-06-23 15:46:08	emaadmanzoor	Yeah?
2014-06-23 15:46:09	pono	Glad to know it's cutting edge ;)
2014-06-23 15:46:15	emaadmanzoor	It's by Armin, same guy behind Flask
2014-06-23 15:46:18	emaadmanzoor	And Pocoo
2014-06-23 15:46:32	pono	Yeah, it was on news.ycombinator.com a couple months back
2014-06-23 15:46:38	emaadmanzoor	Oh awesome!
2014-06-23 15:46:44	emaadmanzoor	It is sort of cutting edge
2014-06-23 15:46:53	emaadmanzoor	But I've looked through the code and it's very neat
2014-06-23 15:47:24	emaadmanzoor	I found a small issue and filed it today, someone's already fixed it.
2014-06-23 15:47:33	emaadmanzoor	So the pace of development seems to be pretty rapid too
2014-06-23 15:47:58	emaadmanzoor	On the REST API side, I tested it on the machine and everything works fine
2014-06-23 15:48:00	pono	It would be a great blog post to talk about what open source products you are using to make Igor.
2014-06-23 15:48:04	pono	Oh fantastic.
2014-06-23 15:48:32	emaadmanzoor	Yes definitely, especially since click is still not mainstream, it will be a good real-world case study
2014-06-23 15:48:45	kennric	emaadmanzoor: where is your code living right now?
2014-06-23 15:49:06	emaadmanzoor	kennric: Hi! The REST API is here: https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/igor-rest-api
2014-06-23 15:49:22	emaadmanzoor	kennric: and the CLI here: https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/igor-cli
2014-06-23 15:50:22	kennric	great, I want to take a look at it, I am not familiar with Click
2014-06-23 15:50:46	emaadmanzoor	Alright, the CLI code with click is not in yet, it will be in an hour or so.
2014-06-23 15:51:49	kennric	ok
2014-06-23 15:52:48	emaadmanzoor	pono: I want to create a screencast of stuff that exists at this point (mid-term). I have some questions that will be clearer once I'm able to walk you through what is there.
2014-06-23 15:53:02	emaadmanzoor	Mostly regarding permissions of users for machines etc.
2014-06-23 15:53:14	pono	Great.  Lets make sure we do that by wednesday.
2014-06-23 15:53:23	emaadmanzoor	Ok cool
2014-06-23 16:30:31	emaadmanzoor	kennric: There is a skeleton API up now.
2014-06-23 16:31:04	emaadmanzoor	You can run the commands and view the help, list of subcommands etc., so the hierarchy is clear. I've based it off CLIs like pip and heroku.
2014-06-23 16:33:30	kennric	cool, looking now
2014-06-23 16:35:06	pono	emaadmanzoor: I got it installed and it runs.
2014-06-23 16:36:42	emaadmanzoor	pono: cool! you can browse around the CLI by running the subcommands, eg. igor, igor auth, igor machines
2014-06-23 16:36:51	pono	Yeah I've tried some out.
2014-06-23 16:36:54	emaadmanzoor	I'm going to mirror the REST API with the subcommand hierarchy
2014-06-23 16:37:34	emaadmanzoor	Each bunch of subcommands will be in a separate .py script, so adding new commands later shouldn't break things too easily
2014-06-23 16:38:45	pono	Awesome.
2014-06-23 16:41:10	emaadmanzoor	pono: This will also be a pip package, so getting it on a machine will eventually be just a pip install git@github.etc.etc.
2014-06-23 16:41:34	pono	That's a good idea.  Not to get too far ahead of ourselves though ;)
2014-06-23 16:41:48	emaadmanzoor	Yeah :-)
2014-06-23 16:43:54	emaadmanzoor	pono: Oh you can do it already
2014-06-23 16:44:00	emaadmanzoor	pip install git+https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/igor-cli.git
2014-06-23 16:44:19	pono	I didn't know pip could do that, that's pretty slick.
2014-06-23 16:44:27	emaadmanzoor	Yeah it's really flexible
2014-06-23 16:44:42	emaadmanzoor	So you don't need to upload it to PyPI, it can be hosted anywhere
2014-06-23 16:46:05	pono	It used to be nice when we hosted PyPI, the download speeds were great! (even though most packages were small anyways)
2014-06-23 16:46:40	emaadmanzoor	Wo I didn't know you guys hosted it, nice!
2014-06-23 16:46:55	pono	yeah, we still host the python.org site
2014-06-23 16:47:04	emaadmanzoor	Ohh :-)
2014-06-23 16:47:24	emaadmanzoor	Good stuff to tell my friends

2014-06-24 13:31:11	s1991	kennric: I'm done with upgrading, pushed it to git. Now only testing is left which I guess mathuin left with only 1.6
2014-06-24 13:32:20	kennric	what is your next task?
2014-06-24 13:33:41	s1991	documenting the changes
2014-06-24 13:33:50	kennric	and have you looked into the upcoming 1.7 django?
2014-06-24 13:34:50	kennric	ok, the midterm evaluation is due on Friday, it would be good to have all the documentation ready well before then so we can review it
2014-06-24 13:36:35	s1991	ya, django 1.7 is now in its beta version, as soon as they release the stable version, we can start working on that
2014-06-24 13:37:34	kennric	if it is not out of beta in time, it would be good to review the beta and document any major changes we'll need
2014-06-24 13:38:04	s1991	kennric: would you suggest something with doc. thing, I mean how I suppose to do it, presently we're having doc in pgd website
2014-06-24 13:40:39	kennric	we are working on putting all the pgd documentation in a Sphinx doc tree in the project itself
2014-06-24 13:41:08	kennric	bug/15999 has the initial doc tree. Have you worked with Sphinx before?
2014-06-24 13:44:01	s1991	I haven't worked with Sphinx before, but since I want to be connected with this org after gsoc, I guess I can help
2014-06-24 13:45:32	kennric	just document the work you have done, http://sphinx-doc.org/
2014-06-24 13:48:00	s1991	kennric: Wouldn't editing existing doc is required, or everything needs to be done from beginning
2014-06-24 13:49:09	kennric	yes, editing the existing docs - right now we are copying the contents of the wiki into the sphinx doc tree, so you might wait until those are in place
2014-06-24 13:49:34	kennric	by the way, how are you testing the changes yourself?
2014-06-24 13:51:09	s1991	I'm not, mathiun is doing that and suggested some issues on v1.4 and v1.5 which I've solved
2014-06-24 13:52:16	kennric	ok
2014-06-24 13:52:19	s1991	So, since why timeline suggest 1week to be spent in documentation, so how should I proceed to it
2014-06-24 13:54:01	s1991	or can I just proceed to my other tasks
2014-06-24 13:54:03	kennric	I see that we had the documentation set to begin after the midterm, but since you are ahead of schedule, I thought it would be good to get started.
2014-06-24 13:54:16	kennric	which other tasks?
2014-06-24 13:56:11	s1991	Vagrant env.
2014-06-24 13:57:07	kennric	yes, that would be a good thing to work on, but maybe spend an hour or two learning sphinx, and make sure the vagrant env is documented
2014-06-24 13:58:02	s1991	sure, I can do that

2014-06-25 08:04:20	Ramereth	pmittal: what's up?
2014-06-25 08:14:03	pmittal	Saw your ping yesterday. I came back a little late and was tired. Our GCDC app Makemymails was among the winners of a competition called Startupdash so I was quite happy that I spent a day partying. :)
2014-06-25 08:14:33	pmittal	Got back to Mirror Syncing API today, I am trying to figure out an authorization scheme.
2014-06-25 08:15:11	pmittal	.. reading about different ways we could have authorization in flask.
2014-06-25 08:15:56	emaadmanzoor	pmittal: I've implemented token-based authentication for my Flask app. You could use that as a start: https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/igor-rest-api/tree/master/api
2014-06-25 08:16:30	pmittal	emaadmanzoor: wow, you are working with on Flask too?
2014-06-25 08:16:58	emaadmanzoor	pmittal: Yeah, I'm building a REST API in Flask
2014-06-25 08:17:13	emaadmanzoor	These are 2 really nice posts that cover authentication: http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/restful-authentication-with-flask and http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-using-flask-restful
2014-06-25 08:17:28	emaadmanzoor	It's easy to build up from there onto more sophisticated stuff like OAuth etc. (if required)
2014-06-25 08:18:26	pmittal	Cool, thanks. :)
2014-06-25 08:18:51	emaadmanzoor	pmittal: And congrats on the Startupdash win :-)
2014-06-25 08:18:56	Ramereth	pmittal: congrats on winning!
2014-06-25 08:19:24	pmittal	thanks Ramereth and emaadmanzoor. xD
2014-06-25 08:19:27	Ramereth	pmittal: ya I mainly just wanted to make sure you were doing ok
2014-06-25 08:19:59	pmittal	ya, doing good. I am a little confused whether I should be integrating the auth into the api.
2014-06-25 08:20:05	pmittal	For example in Ganeti
2014-06-25 08:20:07	pmittal	The RAPI
2014-06-25 08:20:12	pmittal	has a master user id and password
2014-06-25 08:20:18	pmittal	and then GWM takes care of the permissions
2014-06-25 08:20:24	Ramereth	I use "industry standards" for apis such as that
2014-06-25 08:20:38	Ramereth	*I'd
2014-06-25 08:20:50	Ramereth	kennric may have other thoughts about it too
2014-06-25 08:25:43	pmittal	Most industry API's do have auth integrated into them and also define authorization scopes.
2014-06-25 08:25:54	pmittal	did a bit of lookup ^
2014-06-25 08:26:37	kennric	pmittal: the token based stuff that emaadmanzoor is using would work well, I think, that is a pretty standard way of doing it
2014-06-25 08:26:59	Ramereth	my general rule of thumb is 1) pick something standard 2) keep it simple if possible
2014-06-25 08:27:19	kennric	pmittal: also, the midterm evaluation is due by friday, do you have all of your work to date checked in and documented?
2014-06-25 08:28:18	Ramereth	emaadmanzoor: friendly reminder that you need to submit your student eval by friday
2014-06-25 08:28:20	pmittal	yes, all checked in and most of it documented. I'll try to add any missing docs in the next couple of days.
2014-06-25 08:28:56	emaadmanzoor	Ramereth: Will do in the next few hours!
2014-06-25 08:30:43	kennric	be sure to check your proposal timelines - we'll be looking to see that you have completed things you listed as being done before the midterm

2014-06-25 12:51:22	mathuin	s1991: hey there!  I got your email while I was gone but I haven't had time to go through it.  Do you have a few minutes?
2014-06-25 12:52:09	s1991	mathuin: ya sure.
2014-06-25 12:53:32	mathuin	I will retest the v1.4 branch now to see if collectstatic is working now.  You mentioned that v1.6 is available now as its own branch, or as master?
2014-06-25 12:54:00	s1991	no, it is in master
2014-06-25 12:54:29	s1991	ya I myself tested collectstatic, I works fine for me
2014-06-25 12:57:12	s1991	mathuin: kennric mention that team is working on moving doc thing to Sphinx, so should I wait for editing my doc. and move to vagrant env.?
2014-06-25 13:03:33	mathuin	I think it's more important to have useful information collected *somewhere* that you and I can review it.  It can be converted to Sphinx later.
2014-06-25 13:04:00	mathuin	Sorry for the delay.  While I was gone, the computer I use got upgraded.  Yay upgrades!  Fixing vagrant stuff now.
2014-06-25 13:07:11	s1991	ok, so I'll have it write it down somewhere, then start workign in vagrant as well
2014-06-25 13:07:20	mathuin	Yes.
2014-06-25 13:12:47	kennric	mathuin: I asked MaraJade to start moving the wiki docs into sphinx as a base
2014-06-25 13:26:33	mathuin	kennric: woo!
2014-06-25 13:45:27	mathuin	s1991: okay, collectstatic is working, that's awesome!
2014-06-25 13:47:47	mathuin	I'm going to rebuild the virtual machine and try it again.  If it comes out the same, I will try it on zeus.
2014-06-25 13:54:58	mathuin	And that worked well.  Next stop, zeus!

2014-06-25 16:34:51	s1991	mathuin: around?
2014-06-25 16:36:49	mathuin	Yep!
2014-06-25 16:36:55	mathuin	What's going on with json?
2014-06-25 16:38:31	s1991	mathuin: the problm is that we are storing whole of the search object in session variable
2014-06-25 16:38:58	s1991	Now, that gives problm in 1.6
2014-06-25 16:40:11	s1991	Instead we can store the search parameters in form of dictionary
2014-06-25 16:42:00	mathuin	Give that a try, see how it works.  I seem to recall the search object being pretty complicated.  Can you pickle the object and then store it in the session variable?
2014-06-25 16:42:51	s1991	Yes, I guess that is pretty much good idea

I'll finish it this evening and send it across to you, let me know if I should add something in, or take anything out!
2014-06-26 07:10:13	emaadmanzoor	pono: All my pre-midterm code is checked in, though I had to swap the authentication (post-midterm) and IPMI sensors/SOL (pre-midterm) deliverables mentioned in my proposal, I think this is better because I will have a physical machine to test with for all the post-midterm tasks.

2014-06-26 09:42:56	mathuin	Tell me more!
2014-06-26 09:44:21	s1991	I use pickle, but I'm not getting graph in the result, here is the traceback http://pastebin.com/0NWDzfhx
2014-06-26 09:44:32	mathuin	Do you get the big red X
2014-06-26 09:44:49	s1991	yes
2014-06-26 09:45:06	mathuin	Okay.  What operating system are you using?
2014-06-26 09:45:41	s1991	ubuntu 12.04
2014-06-26 09:45:48	s1991	is it due to os??
2014-06-26 09:46:20	mathuin	No, I had it running on 12.04 so you're good there.  What about MySQL, what version are you using?
2014-06-26 09:48:06	s1991	5.5.37
2014-06-26 09:48:12	mathuin	The traceback comes from the SQL template we use in pgd_search/statistics/aggregates.py -- any chance you changed that file?
2014-06-26 09:49:04	mathuin	[version] We're running 5.1.50 here so that is one potential source for difficulty.  Might be worth looking at the MySQL server manual for 5.5 and the release notes since 5.1
2014-06-26 09:49:18	s1991	nope, that's what I was seeing
2014-06-26 09:49:32	pmittal	emaadmanzoor: Is there a special reason to why you have called the file in root directory of igor-rest-api as 'config.py'?
2014-06-26 09:49:43	pmittal	I mean, does flask app pick up configuration from it automatically.
2014-06-26 09:49:52	pmittal	I was using the name *settings.py* and had to do this in my flask app:
2014-06-26 09:49:56	pmittal	file app.config['XYZ_SETTING'] = settings.XYZ_SETTING
2014-06-26 09:50:08	mathuin	s1991: okay, let's both start looking at the MySQL manual there.
2014-06-26 09:50:21	s1991	ok.
2014-06-26 09:52:54	kennric	pmittal: I am pretty sure flask does not care what the file is called. config.py is very common in python apps, but django uses settings.py
2014-06-26 09:53:47	kennric	pmittal: I think in any case, you always have to tell flask where the settings are explicitely
2014-06-26 09:56:04	mathuin	http://www.dabapps.com/blog/logging-sql-queries-django-13/ -- this should tell us the full SQL query that you're seeing which will help us determine which part is at fault.
2014-06-26 10:06:12	pmittal	kennric: hm, makes sense. But I was not understanding why I have to do this step, app.config['XYZ_SETTING'] = settings.XYZ_SETTING in the app in my case whereass emaadmanzoor didn't have to do it.
2014-06-26 10:06:45	pmittal	http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/config/
2014-06-26 10:06:51	pmittal	Reading this at the moment ^
2014-06-26 10:08:04	mathuin	s1991: okay, getting the JSON serializable issue on the master branch, which branch should I be testing the search on?
2014-06-26 10:08:52	s1991	mathuin: let me push some changes done in master, then you can test 1.6
2014-06-26 10:11:32	s1991	mathuin: ok, now you can do it on masters
2014-06-26 10:14:42	s1991	mathuin: actully from where the BinSortSQL function of aggregate is been called
2014-06-26 10:15:09	s1991	so, that we can just console that query out in terminal
2014-06-26 10:25:43	mathuin	Any luck with that?
2014-06-26 10:27:33	s1991	I edited my Logging settings as suggest, but didn't console anything
2014-06-26 10:27:55	mathuin	What's next?  printf-style debugging might work
2014-06-26 10:28:44	mathuin	Okay, latest checkout has good stats but big red X.
2014-06-26 10:29:07	s1991	is there any way, I can console tha particular query from BinSortSQL class?
2014-06-26 10:29:24	pono	emaadmanzoor: Great, I'll review that code now.
2014-06-26 10:29:35	<--	pmittal (~pramttl@59.177.66.76) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2014-06-26 10:33:13	mathuin	Yeah, the instructions from that website worked for me.
2014-06-26 10:34:21	mathuin	http://pastebin.osuosl.org/8281/
2014-06-26 10:35:51	mathuin	Line 11 is our problem query.
2014-06-26 10:38:21	s1991	ya
2014-06-26 10:38:23	mathuin	And I think I see the problem.
2014-06-26 10:39:56	s1991	that query i created via BinSort
2014-06-26 10:40:01	s1991	which is.
2014-06-26 10:41:17	mathuin	The template doesn't seem to be translating correctly.
2014-06-26 10:42:18	mathuin	It's substituting the values, but instead of returning an actual SQL command I think it's returning a string.
2014-06-26 10:46:23	s1991	but atleast that should work directly in mysql
2014-06-26 10:46:31	mathuin	Not with the u'IF()' stuff.
2014-06-26 10:47:02	mathuin	The server sees that as "SELECT 'string' FROM table WHERE 'string'" which is an error.
2014-06-26 10:47:33	mathuin	I now suspect something changed in Django since 1.3.7 that changes how SQLCompiler objects and such are used.
2014-06-26 10:47:37	mathuin	Did you come across any of that in the release notes?
2014-06-26 10:48:51	s1991	no, not till 1.5, though I can look over them again
2014-06-26 10:49:18	mathuin	Knowing that will help figure out where to go next.
2014-06-26 10:50:45	mathuin	Out of curiosity, does your v1.4 or v1.5 branch have this issue?
2014-06-26 10:51:45	s1991	no, they work perfectly
2014-06-26 10:51:52	mathuin	That narrows our search then.
2014-06-26 10:55:32	s1991	are we passing parameters in '%(var)s' as dictinary
2014-06-26 10:57:15	s1991	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.6/#minor-features read second last point
2014-06-26 10:59:03	mathuin	We might be, but that's okay, since we're not using sqlite.
2014-06-26 11:00:37	s1991	no, sqlite is an exception, it is for Mysql and greSQL
2014-06-26 11:01:31	mathuin	Right.  We're using MySQL, and it has long been possible to do it on MySQL, so if that's what we're doing, it's okay. ;-)
2014-06-26 11:01:40	mathuin	I am now trying to find the source to the aggregate code in Django.
2014-06-26 11:01:53	mathuin	BinSort is a PGDAggregate, which is an Aggregate from django.db.models.aggregates.  The initialization of that object will help us determine where along the line something goes Unicode.
2014-06-26 11:03:27	s1991	ohh sorry for misunderstanding
2014-06-26 11:05:07	mathuin	No trouble!
2014-06-26 11:06:51	mathuin	If you go into the PGDAggregate definition, you can try adding print statements to the add_to_query method that print the various objects and their components.
2014-06-26 11:09:51	s1991	yes.
2014-06-26 11:13:09	kennric	mathuin, s1991 : what do you need to have complete for the midterm evaluation? When will you be ready for that?
2014-06-26 11:14:43	mathuin	According to the proposal, Milestone 1 is required for the mid-term evaluation.  Setting up the project for the latest version, installing the lates modules, study release notes, getting the app to run on the new version, change code to use new features, make front end work, and run full site tests.
2014-06-26 11:18:14	kennric	how far are we from that?
2014-06-26 11:18:55	kennric	the evaluation is due tomorrow, I hate to get too close to the deadline
2014-06-26 11:19:18	mathuin	Resolving this issue will probably be enough to make his code work.
2014-06-26 11:19:42	mathuin	And it's a change between 1.5 to 1.6 so I think it can happen today.
2014-06-26 11:20:13	mathuin	The issue appears to be in query_bins() in ConfDistFuncs.py.
2014-06-26 11:21:20	mathuin	The comments near line 341 tell me that there was an issue with Django and aggregates and group by -- that issue may have been solved, we need to find out -- *and* that there were changes in aggregates from 1.2 to 1.3 which may have changed again.
2014-06-26 11:21:28	s1991	mathuin: PGDAgregate console the query which work fine
2014-06-26 11:21:35	mathuin	pastebin?
2014-06-26 11:22:21	mathuin	kennric: the comments for this method include awesome lines like "this is a big hack".
2014-06-26 11:24:18	kennric	lovely. Did you ever grep the source tree for the word 'hack'? Not that I recommend that.
2014-06-26 11:24:23	mathuin	hahahahaha
2014-06-26 11:24:34	mathuin	Also, they hardwired these methods for MySQL
2014-06-26 11:24:55	kennric	ouch, that hits us in the db agnostic milestone
2014-06-26 11:25:11	kennric	is this something we are going to have to re-write?
2014-06-26 11:25:22	mathuin	Change yes rewrite I do not think so.
2014-06-26 11:25:28	mathuin	And that's Milestone 4 so we have a month to worry about it. :-)
2014-06-26 11:28:00	s1991	mathuin: that was consoles the query for fetching search result, which was working fine even before
2014-06-26 11:28:27	mathuin	It worked in 1.5 but doesn't work in 1.6 right?
2014-06-26 11:30:00	s1991	yes
2014-06-26 11:32:30	mathuin	Okay, the crash is coming as the BinSort() object sortx's aggregate.as_sql(qn, cn) is being executed.
2014-06-26 11:40:15	s1991	yes, that' whhy annotated_query show error
2014-06-26 11:41:00	mathuin	When that as_sql runs, it converts the ordinary string of our sql_template into a unicode string.
2014-06-26 11:42:13	mathuin	I am going to force it to be normalized before being output from as_sql.
2014-06-26 11:42:45	s1991	annotated_query consoles nothing, it is empty

2014-06-26 11:49:44	mathuin	This may be a bug in Django 1.6.

2014-06-26 11:59:16	mathuin	I think it might be in the MySQL SQLComiler.
2014-06-26 12:01:31	mathuin	did you work in the ConfDistFuncs.py file?
2014-06-26 12:03:12	s1991	no, there was nothing to be done, as per upgrade
2014-06-26 12:04:55	mathuin	Okay.
2014-06-26 12:06:37	mathuin	Here's where I'm at.  The sql_template is filled in with a piece of Unicode which makes it Unicode which makes it fail.  The piece of Unicode comes from the qn argument around line 357 in sortx_sql (and sorty_sql).
2014-06-26 12:07:09	mathuin	That qn argument is a method on the SQLCompiler object in the django.db.models.sql package.  The method is called quote_name_unless_alias.
2014-06-26 12:08:11	mathuin	That method calls self.connection.ops.quote_name(name) to get the name.  In this case, self.connection is connections['default'] from the django.db package.
2014-06-26 12:09:05	mathuin	Which is really from django.db.utils.ConnectionHandler(), of course.
2014-06-26 12:09:43	s1991	line: 358, seems to be error
2014-06-26 12:10:09	mathuin	That's the call in the PGD source that starts the error trace.
2014-06-26 12:10:17	mathuin	I've thrown in debugging so I don't know exactly where it was, but that does sound right.
2014-06-26 12:14:56	s1991	so what could be the solution of this
2014-06-26 12:19:02	-->	emaadmanzoor (~pingu@109.171.130.235) has joined #osuosl-gsoc
2014-06-26 12:26:59	mathuin	I'm still working on it.
2014-06-26 12:27:23	mathuin	I have gotten past sortx and sorty by changing the quote_name method in the MySQL Django code to cast to string.
2014-06-26 12:34:01	mathuin	The next one is happening when the annotated_query variable is being executed, and that's sorta magic.
2014-06-26 12:35:38	s1991	yes, i've tried printing all annotated_query variable
2014-06-26 12:40:22	mathuin	inspect.getmembers(annotated_query) has been helpful in forcing annotated_query to be evaluated.
2014-06-26 12:42:24	mathuin	Okay, the extra quote character was introduced after the extra line.
2014-06-26 12:42:53	mathuin	'annotated_query = annotated_query.extra(select={'x':sortx_sql, 'y':sorty_sql}'
2014-06-26 12:44:28	mathuin	So I think there's another set of str()'s to place.
2014-06-26 13:11:06	mathuin	OKAY I HAVE OUTPUT
2014-06-26 13:11:10	mathuin	I had to do bad things.
2014-06-26 13:11:17	mathuin	I need to figure out the minimum set of bad things to do.
2014-06-26 13:11:38	mathuin	For now, give this a try -- the sortx_sql and sorty_sql lines in ConfDistFuncs.py -- put [0] at the end of the function call, because all we want is the string.
2014-06-26 13:11:42	mathuin	That *may* be enough.
2014-06-26 13:13:55	s1991	yup, that does work, sorry for this all
2014-06-26 13:14:06	mathuin	No no, dude, it's not your fault.
2014-06-26 13:14:30	s1991	so come, it was perfect till v1.5
2014-06-26 13:14:37	mathuin	They broke it. :-)
2014-06-26 13:14:44	mathuin	I will try to refine the problem down to a single test case.
2014-06-26 13:14:48	mathuin	And then I will submit a bug.
2014-06-26 13:34:02	mathuin	Just tried your code, and it worked.  Going to try it now in the virtual machine.
2014-06-26 13:34:40	s1991	okay

2014-06-27 10:57:52	mathuin	s1991: so, now that Milestone 1's done, what's next?
2014-06-27 10:58:48	s1991	I'm gonna go for vagrant env from today
2014-06-27 10:59:04	mathuin	Excellent.  I've been doing a little work on that front myself, so I feel equipped to assist if you run into some rough spots.
2014-06-27 10:59:21	mathuin	One thing I would like, though, is for you to document what you've done so far, specifically the changes to the code to support later versions.
2014-06-27 11:00:05	mathuin	I also noticed that your git log entries are a little... light. :-)  I realize we haven't discussed how we log commits here at the OSL, but I think it'll help you and us if we use the same style of log entries.
2014-06-27 11:01:30	s1991	yes, documented some of the changes as text and write it down others too
2014-06-27 11:01:35	mathuin	Excellent.
2014-06-27 11:03:21	mathuin	kennric: do we have a style guide for commit messages around, or is it informal?
2014-06-27 11:03:29	mathuin	I think that's an excellent candidate for the developer guide.
2014-06-27 11:03:38	s1991	So from where I can get to know how osl uses log entries
2014-06-27 11:04:14	mathuin	One way is to run 'git log' on the repo to see previous entries.
2014-06-27 11:04:21	mathuin	Another way would be the documentation which I hope exists.
2014-06-27 11:05:20	kennric	http://ganeti-webmgr.readthedocs.org/en/develop/dev/process.html#commit-messages
2014-06-27 11:06:09	s1991	ok, I'm on it
2014-06-27 11:07:30	mathuin	At this point I don't see any value in redoing your previous commits, but from here forward it's best to follow that model.
2014-06-27 11:07:39	mathuin	You'll see that we're not perfect either, but we do try. :-)

2014-06-27 11:10:47	mathuin	At this point, no need to worry there.
2014-06-27 11:11:10	mathuin	Hopefully if you keep on with the project after GSoC you can work on issues and worry about that. :-)
2014-06-27 11:11:13	kennric	s1991: it's a good idea to create issues for any code you want to check in, it is a place to describe the task you are doign and make notes on it, as well as a reference for others
2014-06-27 11:11:36	kennric	at OSL, we don't commit any code without an issue in our tracker, or in github
2014-06-27 11:11:58	kennric	it's a good way to organize tasks, too
2014-06-27 11:12:42	s1991	ok, I can do that
2014-06-27 11:13:21	kennric	also, even though it is for another project, the rest of the dev process document and the developers guide document http://ganeti-webmgr.readthedocs.org/en/develop/dev/developers.html describe our process in general

2014-06-27 15:42:50	s1991	mathuin: according to liveServerTest case "./manage.py test --liveserver=localhost:8082" should test at 8082, am I right
2014-06-27 15:43:50	mathuin	Yes, if you run that command, it will run on localhost on port 8082.  I don't think that matters, though, if there isn't anything already running on the default port.
2014-06-27 15:44:44	mathuin	Since we don't use 8081 (the default), you can use "python manage.py test"
2014-06-27 15:45:07	mathuin	You will definitely want to change the existing references to :8000 in the code.
2014-06-27 15:45:22	s1991	no, but even using --liveserver I had to open new terminal and start server there
2014-06-27 15:45:23	mathuin	The entire "http://localhost:8000/" chunk can be replaced with self.live_server_url
2014-06-27 15:45:31	mathuin	No no, that's the 1.3.7 way not the 1.4 way.
2014-06-27 15:45:35	mathuin	The 1.4 way is one terminal only.
2014-06-27 15:46:13	s1991	and how do I achieve this, I've been test using 2 terminals
2014-06-27 15:47:29	mathuin	When the code comes across a test case of the class LiveServerTestCase, it spins up a server on http://localhost:8081/ for you.
2014-06-27 15:47:34	mathuin	That's why you don't need the second terminal.
2014-06-27 15:47:55	mathuin	You do need to change those tests to use LiveServerTestCase and you need to change the URLs to use self.live_server_url instead of the hardcoded values currently there.
2014-06-27 15:48:17	mathuin	After that is done, you should be able to run the Selenium tests successfully with "python manage.py test pgd_search"
2014-06-27 15:49:55	s1991	but we're using unittest.TestCase instead of LiveServerTestCase
2014-06-27 15:50:12	mathuin	Right, so you make that change for those tests that use Selenium.
2014-06-27 15:50:18	mathuin	Then it'll do the right thing.
2014-06-27 15:56:36	s1991	mathuin: what about this "self.driver.get("http://localhost:8000/search")", this will force to test on 8000 port, do I need to change to achieve that?
2014-06-27 15:57:25	mathuin	You would instead use self.driver.get(self.live_server_url+"/search") or something to that effect.

2014-06-29 15:32:31	pmittal	I am not sure if I described my problem well. I am actually sleepy at the moment.
2014-06-29 15:34:10	pmittal	I see you  have used Flask-Script
2014-06-29 15:34:17	pmittal	emadmanzoor: ^
2014-06-29 15:34:25	emaadmanzoor	hmm
2014-06-29 15:34:42	emaadmanzoor	You need to bind to a context with db.create_all
2014-06-29 15:35:12	emaadmanzoor	pmittal:
2014-06-29 15:35:12	emaadmanzoor	with app.app_context():    
2014-06-29 15:35:13	emaadmanzoor	db.create_all()
2014-06-29 15:35:23	emaadmanzoor	See here: https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/igor-rest-api/blob/master/api/__init__.py
2014-06-29 15:35:25	pmittal	yes.. yes
2014-06-29 15:35:26	pmittal	I tried this
2014-06-29 15:35:36	pmittal	db.create_all step works
2014-06-29 15:35:39	pmittal	after using this
2014-06-29 15:36:05	pmittal	but when I use the app and hit some uri that generates a query
2014-06-29 15:36:11	pmittal	then I get the Runtime error again.
2014-06-29 15:38:13	pmittal	ie. creating the tables step works (because we made it app context aware) but query step fails. Maybe that needs to know an app context too.
2014-06-29 15:39:04	pmittal	^ that's just my thought, shot in air.
2014-06-29 15:42:56	emaadmanzoor	pmittal: Ah yes it's late. We can look at this tomorrow. But it's difficult to tell right away.
2014-06-29 15:43:03	emaadmanzoor	I'll check out the code and let you know
2014-06-29 15:46:58	pmittal	emadmanzoor: sure, thanks!
2014-06-29 15:47:08	pmittal	I'll commit and push the code in my working dir to 'reorganize' branch of mirror-sync-api soon.

2014-06-30 09:41:26	pmittal	emaadmazoor: thanks for the help yesterday. I noticed the problem is rather strange, when you do a query inside the view function
2014-06-30 09:41:26	pmittal	it works perfectly but if you do a query outside the scope of the view function then speifying app in context becomes necessary.
2014-06-30 09:41:42	pmittal	Just adding this line solved the problem for me, which I mentioned about yesterday.
2014-06-30 09:41:43	pmittal	https://github.com/pramttl/mirror-sync-api/blob/develop/master/master.py#L56
2014-06-30 09:42:42	pmittal	Notice, that here: https://github.com/pramttl/mirror-sync-api/blob/develop/master/master.py#L131 , I did not have to specify app context.
2014-06-30 09:42:45	pmittal	And this view function works fine.

2014-06-30 11:06:27	Mathuin	s1991: That is a different project.  phantomjs is a Javascript tool which emulates a web browser, Phantom is just a theme for Django admin sites.
2014-06-30 11:06:49	s1991	Mathuin: ya, I just not figured it out
2014-06-30 11:18:32	s1991	Mathuin: does phantom doesn't require opening browser for testing
2014-06-30 11:18:59	s1991	test just passed without opening any browser
2014-06-30 11:22:25	Mathuin	That's the goal.
2014-06-30 11:22:46	Mathuin	All pgd_search tests should succeed without opening a browser if you do it right.
2014-06-30 11:23:11	s1991	ok then it was pretty simple, just need to edit couple of lines in tests.py
2014-06-30 11:23:18	s1991	yes, its done
2014-06-30 11:25:03	Mathuin	Great!  I think your next milestone is documentation, right?
2014-06-30 11:25:39	s1991	ohh, but I'm not done with vagrant env yet
2014-06-30 11:25:53	s1991	I'm mean if I'm doing it first
2014-06-30 11:26:40	Mathuin	Oh, I thought docs was first.  If vagrant is next, then that's next.
2014-06-30 11:26:50	Mathuin	Your goal there is to make a development environment with chef right?
2014-06-30 11:27:40	Mathuin	Spin up a VM that installs the stuff you need to run PGD (Python, MySQL, etc) and with a settings.py which focuses on that MySQL instance, that sort of thing?
2014-06-30 11:28:07	s1991	no doc was first, I guess I'd discuss it with you that, kennric told it about shifting in Sphenix
2014-06-30 11:28:44	s1991	yes, that's the goal
2014-06-30 11:28:50	Mathuin	Yes.  Writing your documentation in text files is a great first step.  Once you have the content, we can then worry about converting it to restructured text.
2014-06-30 11:28:56	Mathuin	The key there is to get it all down somehow. :-)
2014-06-30 11:30:25	s1991	yes, I'll
