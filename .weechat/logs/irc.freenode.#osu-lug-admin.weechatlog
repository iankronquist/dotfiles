2014-04-29 15:28:35	muricula	edunham: he's gtotten back to us already. Do you think that we should ask if frostsnow can move his talk up?
2014-04-29 15:28:54	@edunham	muricula: ask frostsnow
2014-04-29 15:29:34	muricula	frostsnow: could you give your full disk encryption lug talk next week?
2014-04-29 15:37:51	@edunham	it's mildly uncool to move Wade on this kind of notice though
2014-04-29 15:37:51	@edunham	so if he doesn't want to switch, that's fine
2014-04-29 15:37:51	@edunham	I have a feeling that Carlos won't necessarily have time to get a talk together in 2 weeks
2014-04-29 15:37:51	@edunham	so maybe we should table him till next term, and remind him a couple times over the summer
2014-04-29 15:37:51	@edunham	and then he'll have something awesome
2014-04-29 15:37:51	@edunham	or at least more awesome :3

2014-04-29 16:04:01	@edunham	is this correct?
2014-04-29 16:04:48	akeym	i did?
2014-04-29 16:05:01	akeym	i don't believe i claimed any day, nor was I scheduled
2014-04-29 16:05:05	@jnoah	edunham: why is that a problem?
2014-04-29 16:06:33	deanj	No, I meant on the original list of topics, he was the one designated to give the talk (i think)
2014-04-29 16:07:22	@edunham	oh ok
2014-04-29 16:07:38	@edunham	jnoah: there's a problem? where's the problem?
2014-04-29 17:34:01	akeym	edunham: in any case, i'm not prepared to give that talk - research has been stalled lately

2014-05-01 14:55:12	@edunham	any violation of Freenode policy warrants a kick, especially anything that could be construed as incitement to racial or religious hatred

2014-05-01 14:55:52	bryon	Not unlike the famous Mr. Ed, I endorse that message.
2014-05-01 14:56:26	mathuin	I do not see anything unreasonable in that policy.
2014-05-01 14:56:29	@edunham	yup
2014-05-01 14:56:47	@edunham	just a reminder to everyone with flags in lug that we're responsible for enforcing Freenode's policy
2014-05-01 14:57:42	@edunham	it's entirely outside of lug policy, and rereading Freenode's rules has made me realize that I've actually been violating those policies by advocating tolerance and explanation in certain circumstances
2014-05-01 14:58:23	@edunham	ie it would have been correct for me to kick on hostile references to sexual preferences, rather than just verbally chastise
2014-05-01 14:58:46	@edunham	alright who +q'd all of flip2
2014-05-01 14:58:47	@edunham	not cool
2014-05-01 14:59:42	akeym	it didn't seem to like _Alice_

2014-05-01 15:00:24	@edunham	this may have had to do with the fact that the nick wasn't in the channel
2014-05-01 15:00:25	akeym	dunno, freenode suggested it
2014-05-01 15:00:29	@edunham	oh
2014-05-01 15:01:06	@edunham	might work better when the problem nick is in-channel
2014-05-01 15:01:21	@edunham	tbh though i'd rather do this on next infraction than retroactively
2014-05-01 15:01:32	akeym	i'd also like to make it work properly
2014-05-01 15:01:36	akeym	secl
2014-05-01 15:01:38	@edunham	just 'cause it's kind of sketchy to go "hey we just realized those things a few weeks ago violated policy"
2014-05-01 15:01:50	akeym	not really the point
2014-05-01 15:01:57	akeym	she ducks out before anything can 'happen'
2014-05-01 15:02:13	akeym	well, news flash, you don't need to be in the channel
2014-05-01 15:02:17	@edunham	well yeah, that's why we need to use flags instead of ragequit-provoking remarks...
2014-05-01 15:02:23	@edunham	is it just choking on the underscores?
2014-05-01 15:02:34	akeym	not sure, let me try something else

2014-05-01 15:08:56	@edunham	meh, learning to flags is a noble ambition
2014-05-01 15:09:03	@edunham	also you can just quiet individuals from your client if you so desire
2014-05-01 15:09:25	akeym	my personal ignores don't benefit the channel
2014-05-01 15:10:01	bryon	^^^
2014-05-01 15:10:36	@edunham	'tis true
2014-05-01 15:10:51	@edunham	and it's true that a quiet is a lot less drama-inducing than a ban
2014-05-01 15:44:41	Weyoun	edunham, akeym: Try /mode #channel +b $r:_Alice_
2014-05-01 15:44:45	Weyoun	Or +q
2014-05-01 15:44:59	Weyoun	That I believe matches registered user instead of host mask.
2014-05-01 15:45:14	@edunham	well, we're looking at quiets rather than bans
2014-05-01 15:45:20	Weyoun	So then +q
2014-05-01 15:45:31	Weyoun	Though I am not sure if $r works for +q
2014-05-01 15:45:35	Weyoun	Wanna try it on me?
2014-05-01 15:46:38	Weyoun	Also, I think you may want to set the mode yourself, not go through ChanServ.
2014-05-01 15:53:32	Alan_S	so in another chan, 14:48 _Alice_ | i wonder if that will finally make em grow the fuck up and ban me
2014-05-01 15:54:07	@edunham	we clearly have differing opinions on what it means to behave in a grown-up manner.
2014-05-01 15:54:13	akeym	heh
2014-05-01 15:54:24	Weyoun	And I thought she quit anyway.
2014-05-01 15:54:38	akeym	doesn't mean she has to leave the channel
2014-05-01 15:54:59	@edunham	yeah, +q allows watching the discussion
2014-05-01 15:55:09	@edunham	tbh i would really like to have this codified in rules before we actually use it
2014-05-01 15:55:19	akeym	emergency lug admin meeting
2014-05-01 15:55:20	@edunham	we should have an appeals process for if people actually change their ways
2014-05-01 15:55:21	akeym	hehehe
2014-05-01 15:55:28	@edunham	that can't be used to dos the admin channel
2014-05-01 15:56:48	akeym	now i'm curious what channel she would vent about us in
2014-05-01 15:57:24	mathuin	Does cat have an equivalent channel?
2014-05-01 15:57:46	@edunham	don't worry about it
2014-05-01 15:58:21	akeym	you're right, i probably don't want to know
2014-05-01 16:42:33	mythmon	the thing to know about irc is this: backchannels for days.

2014-05-03 12:52:31	edunham	we should probably have lug vote on how money ought to be spend / fundraising done in the future
2014-05-03 12:52:52	edunham	'cause like... everyone i've talked to has thought getting Dream is a huge improvement, but that may not represent everyone
2014-05-03 12:53:04	edunham	and if we keep spending money at this rate, we'll have to actually start fundraising in a couple years
2014-05-03 12:53:28	edunham	(then again, if we got a dozen alumni to each give us $50/year for the pizza fund...

2014-05-07 13:30:18	deanj	chekkaa: The office is open now :)
2014-05-07 13:30:34	@jnoah	the office was closed?
2014-05-07 13:30:50	edunham	jnoah: he's referring to the club accounts office at the MU.
2014-05-07 13:30:58	edunham	it closes outside of business hours. this is #admin.
2014-05-07 13:30:59	@jnoah	oh! cool
2014-05-07 13:31:55	@jnoah	edunham: i didn't know if you guys started an office of the LUG admin or something last night. or if it was the MU office, or the ASOSU office. There are many, the statement seemed vague, that's why I asked.
2014-05-07 13:32:52	edunham	s'okay.
2014-05-07 13:33:00	@jnoah	I know it's ok. :P
