2014-05-19 10:41:20	Weyoun	Did you get my follow up question?
2014-05-19 10:42:26	muricula	which question?
2014-05-19 10:42:44	Weyoun	About what other day(s) could work for a bike ride.
2014-05-19 10:44:13	muricula	hmmm... I'd have to ask my friends. I will get back to you.
2014-05-19 10:44:28	Weyoun	ok
2014-05-19 10:44:51	Weyoun	Also, I learned this astonishing fact: int f(x) dx = int f(x-1/x) dx for all integrable f.
2014-05-19 10:44:59	Weyoun	Where the integrals are over the entire real line
2014-05-19 10:46:02	muricula	huh
2014-05-19 10:46:14	Weyoun	integral from -infty to +infty
2014-05-19 10:46:35	Weyoun	One of those “How the hell could that possibly be true???” problems I had to do.
