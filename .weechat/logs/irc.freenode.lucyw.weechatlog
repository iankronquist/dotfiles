2014-04-29 20:38:48	lucyw	Hey, virtual?
2014-04-29 20:39:05	lucyw	We went over it briefly in class, but I don't have a very concrete understanding.
2014-04-29 21:02:57	lucyw	Also what's the difference between static and const
2014-04-29 21:31:52		irc: disconnected from server
2014-04-30 20:57:41	lucyw	I had an interesting conversation with several girls in my CS class today.  We each agreed that we really enjoyed coding, and learning new things, at least to varying degrees.  But none of us sees ourselves still coding for anything more than fun in ten years time.
2014-04-30 21:02:02	muricula	was this Shannon? What do tou see tourself doing instead?
2014-04-30 21:20:44	lucyw	Yes, as well as Anne and Yadano and Reilly.  Shannon and I both see ourselves being an "Ellen Momsen" character--starting or heading a program to encourage women to take interest in Engineering/CS/STEM.  Personally, I see myself going more the route of trying to integrate CS curriculum into public middle and high school
2014-04-30 21:55:16	muricula	I don't respect shannon. I don't know the others. Shannon seems like the sort of person who will work at the BSG and not the OSL.
2014-04-30 21:55:38	muricula	She doesn't enjoy programming for its own sake, but rather as a means to an end
2014-04-30 21:58:21	lucyw	Hmmm...that's interesting.  I'm sorry you feel that way.  In thinking about it, my reasons for liking her aren't really one's that you would share.
2014-04-30 22:01:47	muricula	Sorry? What reasons, if I may ask?
2014-04-30 22:09:43	lucyw	Well, as you can imagine, she sympathizes with much of the "I feel really dumb and out of my league and like I'm in the wrong major maybe I should switch to psychology" feelings, and it's nice to have those fears be validated to some degree
2014-04-30 22:10:21	lucyw	I also respect that she puts so much effort into many of the efforts she takes up.
2014-04-30 22:10:53	lucyw	And takes action towards improving the community and lives of others
2014-04-30 22:11:12	lucyw	And like I said--I wouldn't respect her either if I was you
2014-04-30 22:11:25	lucyw	Or, not for the same reasons, rather.
2014-04-30 22:11:49	lucyw	Because the first doesn't apply really, and I don't know that you know her well enough to see the other two.  Plus, we operate on different scales.
2014-04-30 22:11:54	lucyw	(you and I).
2014-04-30 22:13:01	muricula	She is rather by the book too. Which is a bit obnoxious - she would reject any help I offered in favor of the teacher's advice (which I'm sure you know is spotty at best)
2014-04-30 22:15:51	lucyw	True.  Well, again, I'm sorry you don't like her
2014-04-30 22:19:49	muricula	Whatever, there are plenty of other people who I can spend time with.
2014-04-30 22:20:02	muricula	Also, next time you think I look down on tou remember this.
2014-05-01 07:57:12	lucyw	Ooooo....new firefox is shiny O.o  me gusta
2014-05-01 14:41:10	lucyw	Also, I'm finding more and more that spelling mistakes really bother me.  I mean, I get it, people misspell stuff all the time. *I* misspell stuff all the time
2014-05-01 14:41:35	lucyw	But if you don't correct yourself, it just makes you seem kind of...dumb?
2014-05-01 14:42:10	lucyw	ie. jnoah spelled ridiculous "rediculous" twice in the same message.  jnoah--
2014-05-01 15:12:15	muricula	relax, it's part of the nature of our language
2014-05-01 15:13:16	muricula	Rather, learn why words are spelled the way  they are. It's not arbitrary or random
2014-05-01 15:14:02	muricula	Also, wash your hands before using communal keyboards, green's is really greasy  now.
2014-05-01 17:12:43	lucyw	Sorry.
2014-05-01 17:12:45	lucyw	ELI GOT THE JOB
2014-05-01 17:12:47	lucyw	:D
2014-05-01 17:12:49	lucyw	Yay!
2014-05-01 17:12:53	lucyw	Oh my god, I'm so relieved.
2014-05-01 17:13:11	lucyw	Also, if he tells you, pretend you don't know.   Or something.  Act really excited!
2014-05-01 18:06:53	muricula	I gave him feedback on his networking talk
2014-05-01 18:09:10	lucyw	irdan?
2014-05-01 18:10:23	lucyw	Also, things that are bizarre: you know how some concepts are much easier to pick up and master than others?  If albegra/html was a window pane, networking sometimes feels like a black hole
2014-05-01 18:11:08	lucyw	In terms of clarity.  It's not as though it's a complex or hard subject
2014-05-01 18:11:13	lucyw	or like I'm not capable.
2014-05-01 18:11:46	lucyw	It just...I don't know. it's hard to describe.  I just feel like I have a very shaky and terrible grasp of the subject
2014-05-01 18:12:58	muricula	Well that's what the talk was about. From a high level networking is very simple, but it gets horrifically complicated and 'arbitrary' fast.
2014-05-01 18:13:19	muricula	illuminatedgeek knows a lot about networking
2014-05-01 18:13:30	muricula	(simon)
2014-05-01 18:14:20	lucyw	I know his nick :)  and find it mildly amusing.
2014-05-01 18:14:37	lucyw	though he seems kind of ....scary is the wrong word.  Like I'm not worth his time?
2014-05-01 18:14:58	lucyw	Anyway, it's something I'm sure I'll work in at some point, maybe even soon, and come to have a better understanding of.
2014-05-01 18:15:03	muricula	why? I don't think he hardly knows, tou although I may be wrong.
2014-05-01 18:16:26	muricula	ask him what his latest project is. It's pretty cool
2014-05-01 19:42:46	lucyw	Hey!
2014-05-01 19:43:08	lucyw	Actually....let me dick around a little more first.
2014-05-01 19:43:16	lucyw	I might have a question on friends.
2014-05-01 20:23:56	muricula	pong
2014-05-02 01:00:44	muricula	http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_toc.html
2014-05-02 01:00:55	muricula	Feynman's Lectures.
2014-05-02 01:01:39	muricula	Despite their simplicity at the beginning they are better than anything my physics teacher has pulled off
2014-05-02 09:14:24	lucyw	Well, no fuck, it's Richard Feynman.
2014-05-02 09:14:45	lucyw	They actually did a series of TED talks dedicated to him, some of which were very interesting (and not at all over our own heads).
2014-05-02 09:16:35	lucyw	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMaTyg8wR4Y&list=FLrlx6nQZPo3JXHiMOUsaC0g&index=77 <------ Sean Carroll is actually a pretty cool character--I tend to think of him more as the next carl Sagan than Neil DeGrasse Tyson, as he seems better able to communicate complex ideas to non-physics people.

2014-05-02 09:18:06	lucyw	Ok, done for now.  If you prefer reading material instead of visual, I can send you the transcripts of these as well :)
2014-05-02 09:18:19	lucyw	That should be enough for your physics lecture today!
2014-05-02 19:14:37	lucyw	ping
2014-05-02 19:16:22	lucyw	Actually, I'll just leave the question here for you: http://taylorpearson.me/the-antifragile-person/  What's your opinion on an author's own perception of his book?  I think that one of the more beautiful aspects of literature is the ability for a text to be interpreted in several different ways, and for different meanings to be gleaned based on each persons circumstances
2014-05-02 19:17:07	lucyw	However, if an author has (and voices) their own intentions in writing the book, it destroys a little bit of that beauty.  It says "You interpreted my book wrong", which I think is fundamentally impossible and an awfully sad way to see things.
2014-05-02 19:17:50	lucyw	Thoughts?
2014-05-02 20:27:56	muricula	without reading it, I say screw the author, literature is whatever I'd like it to be/
2014-05-02 20:28:17	muricula	s/is/means/g && s/be/mean/g
2014-05-04 19:40:31	muricula	y interesting (and not at all over our own heads).

2014-05-04 19:40:52	muricula	whoops, middle click buffer fail
2014-05-04 19:41:03	muricula	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_%28independence_movement%29
2014-05-04 19:41:41	muricula	^ Have you heard of this? Supposing it were possible would you support such a movement? Do you think it is possible?
2014-05-04 20:16:08	lucyw	Oooo, I like the term bioregion.  I hadn't heard it before the article
2014-05-04 20:18:45	lucyw	I do think it's possible, given that anything is possible with enough people behind it (unless it's overthrowing a Orwellian type of totalitarian government).
2014-05-04 20:19:04	lucyw	I don't think that it will happen though, and I don't think I would support it for a few reasons:
2014-05-04 20:20:02	lucyw	1. New governments take a while to stabilize, and while I care very much about my future children even if this were decidedly a good idea it would take at least 10 years or so to see any significant benefit, which I don't really want to live through.
2014-05-04 20:22:25	lucyw	2. I don't see any pressing reason to do so.  Call me ignorant, but the politics of our region aren't notably different than national politics.  I mean, yes, we're part of a much larger conglomeration trying to serve a more diverse population, but the political climate specific to the northwest is still as divided in interest as the nations
2014-05-04 20:22:36	lucyw	^Did that make sense?  I don't feel like I articulated it very well.
2014-05-04 20:28:52	lucyw	"as well as the beliefs that the eastern federal governments are out of touch, slow to respond, and hinder state and provincial attempts at further bioregional integration"
2014-05-04 20:29:54	lucyw	^ To be honest, I find it quite annoying when people complain about how slow congress is to act.  I mean, the government shutdown fiasco was less than ideal, but I think it's great that Congress is actually *thinking* about and *discussing* decisions before making them.
2014-05-04 20:59:41	lucyw	In fact, I think there are some times when they can act a bit rashly.  I don't know how much you know about the AUMF, but it's a good example of an instance when Congress panicked and passed something without thoroughly thinking through the implications.
2014-05-05 15:05:41	lucyw	out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on gender binary?  Two peoplebehind me are having a discussion about it, and frankly are being idiots.
2014-05-05 16:17:50	muricula	My thoughts about the gender binary are this: I don't really care, other people can be whatever they want, but for goodness sake give me a vocabulary I can use without offending people. LGBTQ etc. is monstorous and unweildy, and the worst part is some people feel it leaves them out.
2014-05-05 16:23:04	muricula	I know that's not just the gender binary, but our culture is in a place where we are still working out the kinks of how to express the zoo of sexually related self identifications. It's hard to address issues of discrimination if we can't explain ourselves clearly and concisely.
2014-05-05 16:26:11	muricula	Besides that, I think it's like religion. You can believe whatever religion you want, and you can identify however you'd like.
2014-05-05 16:29:17	muricula	Also, if I can just dive into the fray, I think iruel/Alice is doing trans people no favors with her behavior. Wherever you may be, you are a representative of your people (American, woman, programmer, hispanic etc. etc.). You should go out of your way to be a good representative of your people because it will affect others' views of your group as a whole.
2014-05-05 18:55:27	lucyw	Well, yes, but in a way that's just saying you should be a good person in general, as we all have several groups we're representing (as you point out), and behaving as she is does a disservice to all her groups of identity, as it would with anyone else.
2014-05-05 18:55:47	lucyw	ie. the way programmers sometimes have a stereotype of being assholes, since some of them kind of are.
2014-05-05 18:57:02	lucyw	The thing with Alice, though, is that 1. She's behaving *very* poorly, and 2. Her primary identity is with a very small, very loud, and very controversial group.  So she's swaying people's opinions on a political topic rather than just making people think some programmers are kind of assholes.
2014-05-05 18:57:19	lucyw	That being said, it's not like it'd be better if she was say you or me.
2014-05-05 18:57:24	lucyw	But I get what you're saying.
2014-05-08 02:26:56	muricula	what do the other media team people do?
2014-05-08 08:18:25	lucyw	Cruise facebook all day, as far as I can tell.
2014-05-08 08:20:01	lucyw	Nah, I think Josh actually works pretty hard.  Or seems to impress Lance at least.  I believe he maintains our social media sites--facebook, youtube, twitter, google plus, and so on.  He makes sure we're within marketing guidelines.  He designs some logos/ads, such as one we had in Drupal's magazine.
2014-05-08 08:20:41	lucyw	Our writer usually writes blog posts/articles, and also checks over anything Lance writes.
2014-05-08 08:21:36	lucyw	Jenn organizes things--like getting a bus to go to a conference, getting plane tickets, seeing how much barcamp will cost, how we can lower the cost.  I tend to think of her as the mom of the OSL (and in fact really like her because she reminds me very much of my own mother).
2014-05-08 11:26:32	muricula	thanks. I ask because Jeff mentioned he might apply for the media team in addition to the sysadmin job.
2014-05-08 11:33:14	lucyw	Ah, yeah!  Josh is graduating, so he totally should!
2014-05-08 11:33:36	muricula	tell him that
2014-05-08 11:43:50	lucyw	message sent.
2014-05-08 15:13:38	lucyw	Does it ever feel unsettling to try to implement something and have it just work the first time?
2014-05-08 15:14:10	lucyw	I added some ai to my Go fish game (just psuedo-random numbers, nothing smart or fancy yet), and it just...worked.
2014-05-08 15:23:15	muricula	depends on how complex the thing you're doing is
2014-05-08 22:07:47	lucyw	I realized there is even more irony to my thinking of you as being judgemental than just digging my own grave, so to speak.
2014-05-08 22:08:00	lucyw	Or perhaps brining judgment upon myself.
2014-05-08 22:09:01	lucyw	But I realized that I was quick to judge you as being judgmental.  Particularly in interacting with you in the 3rd floor lounge setting, I've realized I was pretty wrong on that one, and that you are a really good friend.
2014-05-08 22:11:38	lucyw	So, thank you for being a good friend.
2014-05-08 22:36:12	muricula	I suppose I should thank you instead.
2014-05-08 22:36:21	muricula	s/instead/as well/
2014-05-08 22:36:46	muricula	I was typing and listening to someone else.
2014-05-08 22:38:10	muricula	are you still interested in security? Irdan is trying to put together a network security club. If you're interested join ##hackthegibson
2014-05-08 22:43:54	lucyw	Ooo, yes.  I remember him talking about that--I'd be very interested.
2014-05-09 21:05:15	muricula	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic
2014-05-09 21:05:24	muricula	What do you think about this?
2014-05-09 23:18:18	lucyw	"The MIT group defined a hack as a project undertaken or a product built to fulfill some constructive goal, but also with some wild pleasure taken in mere involvement.'
2014-05-09 23:18:48	lucyw	I like that definition, and find it very interesting the connotations that go along with the word "hacker" depending upon the context in which it's used and who you're with.
2014-05-09 23:22:23	lucyw	What's more interesting, too, is how unique this is to software development and cs.  It's difficult to think of hacking on a business project, or accounting. What's more, though, is that I think many see work as a drab necessity, and not something fun or "undertaken with some wild pleasure taken in mere involvement", which is honestly quite sad.
2014-05-09 23:33:10	lucyw	Why bring it up?  Also, thoughts on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz
2014-05-10 00:14:42	muricula	Someone brought up the word ethos, and that's what my mind went to. This culture is part of what I love about cs. I don't like people who don't get this.
2014-05-10 00:15:02	muricula	By the way, you're right, he is a classic hacker
2014-05-10 00:18:39	lucyw	Was he wronged, though?  Some see him as a hero, others as a representation of hacking gone wrong.  Your view?
2014-05-10 00:18:40	muricula	It's a shame he commited suicide. HE could have done more, but much has been said in his memory more heartfelt and eloquent than I can address.
2014-05-10 00:20:45	muricula	He's not a hero quite. He stood for what he beleived in and paid the consequences legally. The legal system doesn't understand any of this and it's a shame.
2014-05-10 00:20:56	muricula	He did the right thing
