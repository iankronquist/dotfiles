Arch Linux on a Late 2013 Macbook
=================================

I use this role to manage Arch Linux on my late 2013 Macbook Pro

Requirements
------------

This role does not install Arch Linux, or manage partitions. I don't trust
ansible that much.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

None at present

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
